## **VISUALIZING DATA**

In the last set of activities, you were able to make a dataframe.

Now, we will be visiualisng the data using the dataframe you just made. This way we will be able to use things such as graphs in order to represent our data. For example, we'll be learning how to calculate averages of like and retweets and also plotting trends of likes and retweets.

 These skills are useful for many things when using the Twitter API, such as when you need to analyze tweets directly from some users' timeline.

You will be adding on to the same file as the last activity so please don't make a new file.
