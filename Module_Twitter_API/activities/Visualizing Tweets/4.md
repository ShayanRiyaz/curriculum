## PLOTTING ONE DATA SET

Now say we want to see a plot of how number of likes are changing through a time frame. We will be creating a time series. Make count (on the line where you got the timeline of a certain user from the previous activity) equal to 200. This will mean that you're getting this user's likes for 200 tweets over a time span. For the actual code, do this:

```python
time_likes = pd.Series(data=df['likes'].values, index=df['data'])
```

This will use the Series function from the pandas library to create this time series. This function takes 2 arguements and the first here is the data. The data we want is the values from the likes data frame. From every day in 200 days, we will be getting the number of likes. The second arguement here is the index.  The index in this case will be the date so we want the data data frame. 

You can also comprehend data as the x-axis while index is the y-axis.

Next, add:

```python
time_likes.plot(figsize=(16,4), color='r')
plt.show()
```

after the previous line of code to have your graph plotted and printed out after running the program. Figsize is the size of the graph and color is the color of your line in the plot which in this case is red. If red isn't your taste, there's many more colors [here](https://matplotlib.org/examples/color/named_colors.html).

Save and run your program and a graph should pop out in a new window and it should look something like this:
