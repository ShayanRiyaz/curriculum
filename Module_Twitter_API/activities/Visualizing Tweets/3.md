<!--title="Installing matplotlib"-->

Let's get into ploting some data. First we will set it up.

Save the file for now and you will need to go back out to the shell and install something called  matplotlib to help us plot. 

Save and exit the file back out to the terminal and install by typing on the command line: 

```python
pip install matplotlib
```

Pip is just something to help you install matplotlib easily through thr terminal. If it's installed, it should look something like this.

Then, go back to the file and import the mathplotlib.pyplot by adding this:

```python
import the mathplotlib.pyplot as plt
```

Mathplotlib does exactly what the name is which is a libaray to allow you to create plots. In this activity, we will be making line graphs with it. Let's take a look into how to do that!
