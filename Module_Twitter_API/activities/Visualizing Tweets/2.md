<!--title="Numpy and Averages"-->

## INSTALLING NUMPY

Let's start out with something small. Say you want the average length of all the tweets in our data set. 

You have to have numpy library included for this but if you don't, do this:

	include numpy as np

## TAKING MEANS

Now we're ready to start. We'll use the mean() function in numpy. 

```python
print(np.mean(df['len']))
```

What's happening now is that df['len'] wil return a list of all the amount of tweets you've stated from before when you got a user's timeline. The mean() function from numpy will calculate the mean of all the lengths then your program will print it out to the terminal. 

Something like this might print on your screen.

For example, if you set your count (on the line where you got the timeline of a certain user from the previous activity) as 30, the average that you'll receive is the average length of the 30 most recent tweets made by that user. You can run your program and play with different numbers (higher and lower) to see how the mean changes!

Now say if you're wondering what's the number of likes on the most liked tweet in our data set. It's very similar to what you just did except we're using a different function from numpy, the max() function.

	print(np.max(df['likes']))

df['likes'] in this case will be giving a list of some number of like from the data set. 

You can also do this with retweets and so on by replacing the word in the quotes as long as you have access to that data frame.
