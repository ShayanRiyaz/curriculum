## PLOTTING TWO DATA SETs

Next, say we're doing some hardcore analyzing jobs. You may want to plot 2 or more data sets in the same plot. Sure you can do that! It's super similar as if you were only plotting one data set. 

Start by commenting out the previous code you wrote to make a plot. We don't want to have a mixup! Say we want to compare the number of likes and the number of retweets to see if there is a relationship. 

First you can copy and reuse the lines of 

	time_likes = pd.Series(data=df['likes'].values, index=df['date'])
and
	time_likes.plot(figsize=(16,4), color='r')

Except now, you need to take away color and replace it with label and legend, which will look like this:

	time_likes.plot(figsize=(16,4), label="likes", legend=True)

Turning legend to be true will give you a little legend box on the corner of the plot to tell you which color is which data set. Reapeat this for retweets by doing this:

	time_retweets = pd.Series(data=df['retweets'].values, index=df['date'])
	time_retweets.plot(figsize=(16,4), label="retweets", legend=True)

At last, show the plot:
	

â€‹	plt.show()

Run you program and it should look something like this:

Nice work!
