## Porter Stemming

There are a few different types of stemming so let's start with porter stemming.

Staying in the same Jupyter file, type:

	from nltk.stem import PorterStemmer
	pst = PorterStemmer()

This imports Porter Stemmer from the nltk stem library. ``pst`` will be a newly instantiated PorterStemmer object.

Let's try it. Type:
	
	pst.stem("having")

Press enter and the output will be ``have`` which is the root for the word ``having``.

Similarily, if you give it a list of words to stem, it will give the origin of every word in the group.

	wordsToStem = ["give","giving","given","gave"]
	for words in word_to_stem:
		print(words +": " + pst.stem(words))

``wordsToStem`` is the list of words in the type string that we want to stem. Make sure the words are strings.

The for loop will go through the list, stem every word using the stem function, and print it in the format of ``word: origin``.  

The ouput will be
	

	give: give
	giving: give
	given: given
	gave: gave
