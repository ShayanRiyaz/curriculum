<!--title="Working with POS"-->

Let's bring POS into our code and see what happens.

First, import fucntions we will use:
	from nltk import pos_tag, word_tokenize
	
Then we're going to use a sentence on POS so type:
	sent = "Timothy is a natural when it comes to drawing"
	sentTokens = word_tokenize(sent)
	
``word_ tokenize()`` function means for the string to split off punctuation other than periods.

Next, add:
	for token in sentTockens:
		print(nltk.pos_tag([token]))

Output should be

- [('Timothy', 'NN')]
- [('is', 'VBZ')]
- [('a', 'DT')]
- [('natural', 'JJ')]
- [('when', 'WRB')]
- [('it', 'PRP')]
- [('comes', 'VBZ')]
- [('to', 'TO')]
- [('drawing', 'VBG')]

  to know what each descroption is.

Next, we're going to stop with the coding but just understand some more of the concepts in NLTK that deals with words similar to POS.
