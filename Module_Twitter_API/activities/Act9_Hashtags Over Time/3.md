<!--title="Set-up"-->

There's really not much set up since you should have already wrote code for previous activities so open up the file where you did the visualizing tweets/detecting bots activities in because we're add on to that.

First, we're going to make a slight change to the previous code we wrote in the last activites. 

In your code, you have already have a Pandas dataframe all set up so scroll up to where you made the ``Timestamp`` dataframe and edit it to this:
```python
tweets['Timestamp'] = pd.to_datetime(tweets['Timestamp'], infer_datetime_format = "%d/%m/%Y", utc  = False)
```
Instead of what we had before, we're going to use the ``to_datetime`` function this time. The function is from the Pandas library and it converts string Date time into Python Date time object.

Next add:

```python
def giveday(timestamp):
    day_string = timestamp.day
    return day_string
  
tweets['day'] = tweets['Timestamp'].apply(giveday)
days = tweets.groupby('day')
daycount = days['text'].count()
timedict = daycount.to_dict()
```

We need this function to make a day of the DateTime object into a Python datetime object.
