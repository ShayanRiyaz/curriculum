# Intro to Pandas

Before we jump into the main section of this week, let explain some of the core concepts of Pandas.

Pandas is the bread and butter of all data scientists in this day and age. This Python package let's us *easily* maniupulate tabular data. The term "pandas" is short for "**PAN**el **DA**ta," an economics term. Pandas also has really good documentation! https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/



## Series

As mentioned above, Pandas let's us manipulate tabluar data. Tables consist of rows and columns. Essentially, our columns are made up of individual **Pandas Series**. We'll get back to data frames later.

A Pandas Series is a one-dimensional array that can hold data of any type! This include integers, strings, objects, you name it! Let's look at these examples:

```python
import pandas as pd
bball_teams = pd.Series(['Warriors', 'Lakers', "Raptors"])
numbers = pd.Series([100,1.4,-7])
```

Notice how each of the series are *essentially lists*, and I used strings in the first and integers in the second!

### Indexing

One functionality of Series is that it can be used like an **ordered dictionary**! By default, the index of each element is its order in the series (starting from 0). However, you can assign a new index to each element of the series. Let's check out this example:

```python
presidents = pd.Series(['Trump','Obama','Bush Jr.'])
presidents
presidents[0]
```

As we can see, `presidents` are indexed in the order they are in the list, starting from zero. Also, you can call the element from the series by using their index and a [ ]. Here `presidents[0]` outputted `'Trump'` since he is the 0th element of the list.

What if we wanted to index them by the number president they currently are?

```python
presidents = pd.Series(['Trump','Obama','Bush Jr.'], index = [45,44,43])
presidents
```

Now the Series `presidents` is indexed by the number president they are!
