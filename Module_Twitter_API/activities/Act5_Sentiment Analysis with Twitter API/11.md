## Regular Expressions [Character Classes]

> Hold on! What if I want accept different types of characters but I want to be very  general and accept entire "classes" of "characters"... I think you answered your own question ;)

Together now:

* `\d` accepts or matches a single numerical character or digit in your string.
  * Its negation or opposite is `\D`. This accepts all non-digit characters.
  * For example `/\d player/` --> accepts --> "1 player","2 player", and beyond.
* `\w` accepts or matches a single "word" or alphanumerical character(including the underscore "_").
  * Its negation or opposite is `\W`. This accepts all non-word characters.
  * For example `/player \w/` --> accepts --> "player a","player _", and beyond.
* `\s` accepts or matches a single whitespace character (like tabs(`\t`),new lines(`\n`), carriage return(`\r`) and spaces).   
  * Its negation or opposite is `\S`. This accepts all non-whitespace characters.
  * For example `/\s player/` --> accepts --> "\t player"," player", and beyond.
* `.` matches all characters!
  * For example `/\d player/` --> accepts --> "1 player","m player", and beyond.
* Special escape characters like `$` and `^` need to have a backslash(`\`) to be recognized by Regular Expression rules. 
  * For example `/\^ player/` --> accepts --> "^ player".
