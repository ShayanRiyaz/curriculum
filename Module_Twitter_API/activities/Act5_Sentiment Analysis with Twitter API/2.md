<!--title="Installing Textblob"-->

## Using Textblob

The first task we have to perform is installing a python module called *TextBlob*.

Which is done by the following command:

```python
pip install textblob
```

After installing it, we will now need to import this module into our program. This can be done with:

```python
from textblob import TextBlob
```

It'd be incredibly difficult to develop our own application to analyze the sentiment/context of each tweet. We would have to give it a ton of input to get it used to human writing patterns and write lots of icky, mathematical code! Text Blob does all of that for you out-of-the-box and gives you an API (a method to easily interface with it)!
