> Sometimes you're not sure what exactly your input string is going to look like, but you know what the possible characters are for your string...OR operator to the rescue!

Here we go again:

* Say we have two strings "I want an apple!" and "I want and orange!". We want to accept both but they are pretty different! However, notice that only "apple" and "orange" change in both strings. Here we can see there is an option for either "apple" **or** "orange".
  * So let's make a rule for it!: `/I want an (apple|orange)!/`
  * Think  of `|` as the word 'or' and now things are making sense!
  * You can also use more than two options: `/Hi (Kevin | Patrick | Sandy), I am your biggest fan!/` --> accepts -->  "I am your Kevin biggest fan!" , "I am your Patrick biggest fan!" , and "I am your Sandy biggest fan!"
  * You can also make character options: `/The answer is (a|b|c)./` --> accepts --> "The answer is a." , "The answer is b.", and "The answer is c."
