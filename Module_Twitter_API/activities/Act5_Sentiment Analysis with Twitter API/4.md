## Deleting Data

There are two ways of deleting data from a DataFrame:

1. `drop` - to delete rows

   `df.drop('Store 1')` will return ***a copy*** of `df` without the rows associated with 'Store 1'. This is the default behavior for most data structures in Pandas - in-place changes do not occur on Pandas data structures. This method does not edit `df` itself!

   |           | Cost | Item Purchased | Name  |
   | --------- | ---- | -------------- | ----- |
   | *Store 2* | 5.0  | Bird Seed      | Vinod |

2. `del` - to delete columns

   You can directly delete a column from a DataFrame. `del df['Name']` will delete the Name column from `df`:

   |           | Cost | Item Purchased |
   | --------- | ---- | -------------- |
   | *Store 2* | 5.0  | Bird Seed      |

   The best practice is to **make a copy** of a DataFrame and test your changes before interacting with it directly.
