## Regular Expressions [Continued]

Before we jump right in(and I know your excited to do so), we need to understand the core idea behind Regular Expressions and how we can use them in our sentiment analysis code!

Here is an upcoming example of Regular Expressions you will see:

```
"(@[A-Za-z0-9]+)|([^0-9A-Za-z\t])|(\w+:\/\/\S+)"
```

I know...very scary ðŸ’€.

But don't be afraid! Lets go character by character and see what's going on here!

However, it is important that you imagine the above Regular Expression as a machine that takes in tweets and "cleans"(i.e remove links,weird character's and twitter mentions/handles) them(I am foreshadowing the next card here).

Lets start with "'`(@[A-Za-z0-9]+)`":

* "( ... )" :  Capture Group. You specify a Regular Expression inside the parenthesis and text that follows the Regular Expression rules is extracted. Think of a Regular Expression as rule itself! It specifies what a type of string(either that you want to make or accept).
* "@"  :  Each tweet that mentions or tags another user has this character at that start and the word/name afterwards.
* "[A-Za-z0-9]" : This is what you call a character set. You are setting up a rule here that recognizes all capital and lower case alphabets and digits from 0-9.

* "+" : This is a indicator that you want the preceding "token" or sub-rule to be recognized one or more times.
* If we put it all together: we want to extract all the twitter handles from our given input tweet. Note that a mention ends when either we run into space after it or the end of the actual tweet - we mimic this behavior here as well.

What does the "|" stand for? It stand for an "or" operator. We use it when we want to create multiple capture groups that all extract different things from the same input string(or tweet in this case).

Okay, lets go on to "`([^0-9A-Za-z\t])`"

* "^" : Stands for "not" or negation. We are making a rule that will extract the negation of the following character set.
* "[0-9A-Za-z\t]" : Again, this stand for a character set that recognizes all capital and lower case alphabets and digits from 0-9. However, you'll notice that it also recognizes tabs (or \t which represent tabs).
* If we put it all together: we want to extract all non-alphanumeric characters(with the expectation of tabs) from our tweets.

Lets finish this with a `(\w+:\/\/\S+)`!

* "\w" : Stands for an alphanumerical "word" or string(i.e anything that you would imagine being represented by regular characters).
* ":" : This rule specifies that we want to recognize the colon character.
* "+" : This is a indicator that you want the preceding "token" or sub-rule to be recognized one or more times.
* "\/\/" : What is this thing!!! Well it makes a rule that we want to recognize double back slashes like '`\\`

* \S: This rule specifies that we want to recognize **ALL** non-whitespace characters (e.g "!","A", " ").
* If we put it all together: We want to extract all links from our tweet! As all links start in the format specified above- `word:\\another_word_with_no_whitespaces`

Here is an example of it(the entire Regular Expression) actually recognizing all the things(the things highlighted in blue) we want to clear out of our tweets:
