## Regular Expressions [Continued]

Before we jump right in(and I know your excited to do so), we need to understand the core idea behind Regular Expressions and how we can use them in our sentiment analysis code!

Here is an upcoming example of Regular Expressions you will see:

```
"(@[A-Za-z0-9]+)|([^0-9A-Za-z\t])|(\w+:\/\/\S+)"
```

I know...very scary ðŸ’€.

But don't be afraid! Lets go character by character and see what's going on here!

* "( ... )" :  Capture Group. You specify a Regular Expression inside the parenthesis and text that follows the Regular Expression rules is extracted. 
* "@"  :  Each tweet that mentions or tags another user
