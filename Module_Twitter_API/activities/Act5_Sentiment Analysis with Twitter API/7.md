Another module that we would find useful is `re`. This stands for regular expression and we will be using it to "clean" our tweets. Using `re`, we will remove special characters, hyperlinks, and other unnecessary data that doesn't help with Sentiment Analysis. 

Import `re` like so: 

```python
import re
```

 But what *exactly* are Regular Expressions? Think of them as a bunch of guards protecting a castle!

> You give the guards a rule (e.g only allow people with red coats to enter) and they let people you abide the the rule in and the people who don't out!

Lets expand it now is programming sense...

> You write down a bunch of rules that specific what type/configuration of string(e.g string with all the letters i's) you want. But what do want? You can either extract portions out and store them or check if a specific rule/specification is followed by a given string or not.
