## Sentiment Analysis

We've used twitter's API to extract all kinds of data from tweets. Having proficiency over *Tweepy* will allow us to perform all kinds of tasks.  One of example of such tasks is **sentiment analysis**. The goal of sentiments analysis is simple: to tell you if a piece of text has a negative or positive context.<sup>1</sup>

A example of a "positive" tweet might be:

But I know what you're thinking - why should I care! Well, big companies like Google and TripAdvisor harvest customer feedback and comments and use it to improve their businesses.<sup>2</sup>  If you know what your customer wants (and people really make that clear on social media), you can make the necessary adjustments on your end.
