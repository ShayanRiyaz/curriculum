## Adding Data

Adding a column to a DataFrame is super simple. Simply index a new column and assign it to an array value. If I want to add a location to each purchase, I make a new column `df['Location']` and assign it to an array of locations `['St. Louis', 'St. Louis', 'San Francisco']`:

`df['Location'] = ['St. Louis', 'St. Louis', 'San Francisco']`

Assuming I have the original `df` table, the new `df` will look like so:

|           | Cost | Item Purchased | Name  | Location      |
| --------- | ---- | -------------- | ----- | ------------- |
| *Store 1* | 22.5 | Dog Food       | Chris | St. Louis     |
| *Store 1* | 2.5  | Kitty Litter   | Kevyn | St. Louis     |
| *Store 2* | 5.0  | Bird Seed      | Vinod | San Francisco |

Try interacting with all of these functions in Jupyter before proceeding! You'll find that it's quite intuitive.
