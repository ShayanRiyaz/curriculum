> The final piece to our basic Regular Expression puzzle: Bracket Expression. Now we can match or accept entire groups of letters or symbols.  Imagine it is like an extended 'or' operator.

The final countdown:

* Something like `/[A-D]/` captures all characters(upper case if no flag is specified) from A to D. So a string like "BAD" gets accepted.
* A more complex example would be `/[A-Da-f1-9]/`which captures characters A to D, a to f and 1 to 9. So a string like "1Ab9" gets accepted.
* Finally, you should note that all characters and escape characters lose their special meaning so there is no need to add `\` next to escape characters any more. Something like `\[!?]\` would work just fine and would accept ""!!??".
