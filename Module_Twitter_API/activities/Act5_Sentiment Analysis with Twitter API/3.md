## Advanced DataFrame Operations

### Grouping

The `.describe()` method gives us nice summary statistics for each column of our data frame.  This method gives you your favorite summary statistics for each column (i.e. mean, standard deviation, count, etc.). 

That's nice and all, but what happens if we want something a little more complex? Imagine we have a dataframe that represents info about different types of dogs and is aptly named "dogs".

The `.groupby()` method allows you to group the data before computing these aggregate statistics. Let's take a look at this example.

```python
dogs.groupby("breed").mean()
```

What did this do? The dataframe was first grouped up by the column `"group"` , then the mean of the columns for each of the groups were calculated. Notice that they were grouped **BEFORE** the mean was calculated. Now we can get the mean of every column in the data frame for each breed. That's powerful!

We can also group by multiple columns!

```python
dogs.groupby(["group", "size"]).mean()
```

This grouped *both* `"group"` and `"size"` before the summary statistics were calculated. Double powerful!
