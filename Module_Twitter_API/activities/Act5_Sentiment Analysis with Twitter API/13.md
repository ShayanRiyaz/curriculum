## Regular Expressions [Grouping and Capture]

> We use capture group (...) to help us extract information and to use regular expressions on groups of string or other rules. 

Almost there now:

* Just using something like `cool(cat)` will allow us to access multiple matches like an array and use rules on the entire `cat` portion of the string.
  
  * In python (with the module `re`), we could use the `.group` method and access the groups we have matched.
    * For example a line like `reg_expression_matching.group(1)` would gives "wow" if had a string like "wow cool" and a regular expression like `\(.)* cool\ `. This is because that `(.)` was the first capture group(hence the `.group(1)`)!
  
* The ` ?:` disables the array access feature: `/cool(?:cat)/`.
  * The  `?<...>` gives a capture group a name(something useful for our array-like access: `/?cool(<g1>cat)/`
