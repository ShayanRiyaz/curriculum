## Add to Data frame

Now that we've built our function that tells us the sentiment of the tweets, we can now integrate that data into our data frame. We want to call our `tweetAnalyzer` function for every existing `tweet` in our data frame(we get these tweets by looping through all our tweets currently in our data frame).  These lines of code should fall under our if statement. We will finally add the sentiments of each tweets as a new column in our data frame(and populate it with each tweet's respective sentiment).

```python
tweet_analyzer = TweetAnalyzer()
df['sentiment'] = np.array([tweet_analyzer.analyze_sentiment(tweet) for tweet in df['tweets']])
```
