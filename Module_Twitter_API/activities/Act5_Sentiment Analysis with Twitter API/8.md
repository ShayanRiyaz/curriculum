> Sometimes you need to find/check/extract/substitute something at the start or end of a string. Anchors come in handy in such cases!

Lets start out with the basics:

* We start our Regular Expressions by opening up a `/` and writing all the rules between that and a `/`.
  * Something like: `/RULES/`

* `^` and `$` are called anchors and matches(or finds/extracts) a specified string or character within a larger string  at the start or just the end,respectively.
  * So when we write` \^wow,\` the following string gets accepted : "wow, you are learning a lot!". 
  * When we write `\$bye!\` the following gets accepted: "nice work, bye!"
  * Now let's combine them: `\^Eat $vegetables\` --> accepts --> "Eat more vegetables".
