## Regular Expressions [Flags]

> Now we need some way to tell our Regular Expression rules to change the way how it looks at our rules and input. Here we use flags.

Into the abyss we go:

* Adding a `g` at the end of our Regular Expression will tell it to look and match things in the **entire** string not just the first instance of each.
  * e.g `/some rule goes here/g`

* Adding a `m` at the end of our Regular Expression will tell it to look at our rules and assume that our anchors(`^` and ` $`) get restarted after the end of each line(which is signified by a `\n`).
  * e.g `/some rule goes here/m`

* Adding a `i` at the end of our Regular Expression will tell it to look at our rules and assume everything is case-insensitive (a is treated as A and vice versa)

* e.g `/some rule goes here/i`
