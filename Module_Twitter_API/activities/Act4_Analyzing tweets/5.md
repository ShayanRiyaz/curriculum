<h1>Creating a DataFrame using Pandas</h1>
Now what we can do is we can go ahead and create a data frame which is going to store that content and just going to allow us to neatly organize that and also to process it for further data analysis later so we're going to make use of the Numpy and Pandas modules that we imported.

<<<<<<< HEAD
We'll start by creating a class that we'll be using to analyze our tweets later. Let's call this class `Class TweetAnalyzer()`.  Now let's create a function `def tweets_to_data_frame` that will take the JSON data we have and convert it into a data frame categorized by the text for our future use.
=======
The following lines will go through the tweets we send in and gives us the tweet id (think of it as a unique id number given to each tweet). We then make a id column in our data frame and add the respective data to each tweet in said table/data frame.

Here, the Pandas library has an inbuilt function `DataFrame()` that does the conversion of our tweet data into a Data Frame. 

A Data Frame is a tabular data structure with labeled axes (rows and columns) just like an Excel or Google Slides Table! 

We feed in the data by iterating through our `tweets` object and feeding in the `tweet.text`. It extracts the data from the `Tweets` key in the JSON file(remember that JSON acts like a key and value pair, where each key is associated with a  piece of data ) and returns it as a column (of a Data Frame).

```python
class TweetAnalyzer():
    def tweets_to_data_frame(self, tweets):
    	df = pd.DataFrame(data=[tweet.text for tweet in tweets], columns=['Tweets'])
        return df
```

Now to take advantage of this newly created class, we are going to create a object of this class inside our **main** routine and call the function on tweets.

```python
tweet_analyzer = TweetAnalyzer()
df = tweet_analyzer.tweets_to_data_frame(tweets)
```

 Now let's print the first 10 `tweets` in our Data Frame by `print(df.head(10))`.
