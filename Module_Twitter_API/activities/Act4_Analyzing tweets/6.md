<h1>Analyzing the tweets</h1>
Finally the most exciting part...analyzing the tweets! We already have the text field set up so now let's add columns for other fields such as the id, likes, retweets, etc. We do so by using the numpy arrays and adding one column at a time. The data fed into this is similar to what we did before.

The following line will go through the tweets we send in and gives us the tweet id(think of it as a unique id number given to each tweet). We then make a id column in our data frame and add the respective data to each tweet in said table/data frame.

```python
df['id'] = np.array([tweet.id for tweet in tweets])
```

The following line will go through the tweets we send in and gives us the textual length of each tweet. We then make a length column in our data frame and add the respective data to each tweet in said table/data frame.

```python
df['len'] = np.array([len(tweet.text) for tweet in tweets])
```

The following line will go through the tweets we send in and gives us the date a tweet was posted.  We then make a date column in our data frame and add the respective data to each tweet in said table/data frame.

```python
df['date'] = np.array([tweet.created_at for tweet in tweets])
```

The following line will go through the tweets we send in and give us the device type a tweet was posted from. We also make a column for this in our data frame.

```python
df['source'] = np.array([tweet.source for tweet in tweets])
```

The following line will go through the tweets we send in and give us the number of likes a tweet gets. We also make a column for this in our data frame(who would have guessed :o).

```python
df['likes'] = np.array([tweet.favorite_count for tweet in tweets])
```

Finally, the following line will go through the tweets we send in and give us the number of times a tweet gets retweeted. Yes...we add it to our data frame too!

```python
df['retweets'] = np.array([tweet.retweet_count for tweet in tweets])
```

So what we have now is(by using `print(df.head(10))` to get the first 10 items in our Data Frame),
