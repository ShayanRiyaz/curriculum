<h1>Streaming our first tweets</h1>
So now that we have an API set up, we can start by streaming(i.e getting a live feed of content) some tweets. So let's go ahead and create a variable called *tweets* that will store the data we'll be obtaining from the client that we just created. We'll use an inbuilt function, **user_timeline** to stream the tweets from Twitter (think of a user's timeline as their homepage where all their tweets from the people they follow are hosted). So let's specify someone well known as the twitter handle and specify the number of tweets we need.

Now on printing `tweets`, we should get the most recent 20 tweets in JSON format. Looks spooooky! However, think of it as "raw" data(or a diamond in the roughðŸ’Ž) which will analysis later on. The JSON formatting will actually come in handy later on as it will let us access data in logical manner. Meaning Python will call for a specific piece data by name(like  this ` ingredients["burger"]`) and it will give you it data (like `["meat","buns","lettuce","condiments"]`)like an array!

The data frame will held in ``df`` .

Print the first 10 `tweets` in our data frame by typing  `print(df.head(10))`.
Since ``df`` is a data frame, we can use the ``.head()`` function from the pandas library to  to get the first n rows where n is 10 in this case.

Run your program and you should see somethin similar to this print out.
