<h1>Creating a DataFrame using Pandas</h1>
Now what we can do is we can go ahead and create a data frame which is going to store that content and just going to allow us to neatly organize that and also to process it for further data analysis later so we're going to make use of the numpy and pandas modules that we imported.

We'll start by creating a class that we'll be using to analyze our tweets later. Let's call this class `TweetAnalyzer()`.  Now let's create a function `tweets_to_data_frame` that will take the JSON data we have and convert it into a data frame categorized by the text for our future use.

```python
class TweetAnalyzer():
    def tweets_to_data_frame(self, tweets):
        df = pd.DataFrame(data=[tweet.text for tweet in tweets], columns=['Tweets'])
        return df
```

A JSON file is an open-standard file format or data interchange format that uses human-readable text to transmit data objects consisting of attributeâ€“value pairs and array data types. 

Here, the Pandas library has an inbuilt function `DataFrame()` that does the conversion of our tweet data into a data frame. A data frame is a tabular data structure with labeled axes (rows and columns). We feed in the data by iterating through our tweets object and feeding in the `tweet.text`. Now, let's return the Data Frame.

To take advantage of our newly created class, we are going to create a object of the ``Tweet Analyzer`` class inside our **main** routine and call the function ``tweets_to_data_frame`` on tweets to make a data frame out of it.

```python
tweet_analyzer = TweetAnalyzer()
df = tweet_analyzer.tweets_to_data_frame(tweets)
```

The data frame will held in ``df`` .

Print the first 10 `tweets` in our data frame by typing  `print(df.head(10))`. 
Since ``df`` is a data frame, we can use the ``.head()`` function from the pandas library to  to get the first n rows where n is 10 in this case. 

Run your program and you should see somethin similar to this print out.
