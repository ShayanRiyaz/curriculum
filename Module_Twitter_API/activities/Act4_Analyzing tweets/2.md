Let's start by setting up the twitter API. Firstly, let's setup a function inside our `TwitterClient` class that will return the API. This will help us understand what we are doing more clearly later on. We do so as follows:

```python
def get_twitter_client_api(self):
        return self.twitter_client
```

Next, let's create a twitter client which we'll use to analyze the tweet data of the user we'll be specifying that we'll be receiving in JSON format(which is just a useful and standardized way to store our data). We'll start by removing the existing code inside the main portion of our file and create an object of the `TwitterClient()` class called `twitter_client`. 

```python
twitter_client = TwitterClient()
```

Now let's get the API through the function we just created and store it inside a variable for analyzing in the future.

```python
api = twitter_client.get_twitter_client_api()
```
