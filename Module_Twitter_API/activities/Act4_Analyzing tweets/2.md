<h1>Brief Intro to JSON</h1>

We store all our tweets in a *"JSON"* format(this becomes important in the later cards). But what is JSON and why are we using it!

JSON stands for **JavaScript Object Notation**. In essence, it is a standardized data writing format based on the way the programming language JavaScript stores its objects.

Think of JSON as a compressed way of writing things like Morse code! It can be decoded and read by programs  in such a way that makes it more intuitive to handle data.

But what does "intuitive" mean here? You'll soon find out!

#### Writing and Reading JSON

***

You always start a JSON file with brackets, with each data element seperated by a ```,```:

```
{
	...,
}
```

You then add your data in a key-value format! You can think of the key as a category or type while the value is the actual data. Something like this: `"Key":"Value",` .  You can also make lists in your JSON file!

``` 
{
	"Name" : "John Smith",
	"Age" : 23,
	"College" : "UC Redding",
	"Favorite Colleges" : ["UC Redding", "UC Santa Rosa" , "UC San Jose"],
}
```

> Notice we implicitly specify the types of our data above by using ".." for strings and numbers without quotations as integers.



#### Accessing data

***

Now to the reason why we use JSON: it allows us to interface with our data in a very simple way. 

Remember we access an array by giving the index or address of the value we want to access.  In JSON we do the same thing but this time we can give it anything as an index(as long as it is a valid key)!

```
{
	"Name" : "John Smith",
	"Age" : 23,
	"College" : "UC Redding",
	"Favorite Colleges" : ["UC Redding", "UC Santa Rosa" , "UC San Jose"],
}
```

If we want John's age all we need to do is : load the JSON values into a variable like `John_Data` and make the following access : ` John_Data["Age"]`.

#### Nesting

***

The final topic we will discuss here is nesting - yes you can have JSON in yo' JSON.

Here is an example:

```
{
	"Fruits":{
		"Favorites" : ["Apples","Oranges"],
    	"Dislike" : ["Banana","Pineapple"]
	},
}
```

The way you would access them is quiet similar to what you say above(but with layers this time). You load it into a variable called Food. And access the `Dislike`s like this: `Food["Fruits"]["Dislike"]`



#### Finishing Up

***

Recall that we store our tweet data in groups like by text,source,etc. . So it only makes sense to use a data storage format that complements this: JSON.
