By the end of this activity, we'll be able to stream and analyze tweets from a specific user. We'll be using the tweepy library along with Pandas and Numpy to format our tweet data that we'll be analyzing later. So let's start by setting up Pandas and Numpy.

<h1>Setting up Pandas and Numpy</h1>
Let's start by setting up Pandasüêº and Numpyüî¢.

Pandas is a open-source and free to use python library/package that allows us to analysis and collect our data from various sources much more easily.<sup>1</sup> We will use it to collate and analyse our tweets.

Numpy is a free to use python package that allows us to use more complicated and useful mathematical functions in our code.<sup>2</sup> We will be using it for its "Array" type/class, which will allow use to add data that we can manipulate (in a efficent manner) to our Pandas "data frame" or table.

 If you don't have these installed, you'll have to run the following commands.

```bash
pip install Pandas
pip install Numpy
```

And then, In order to use Pandas and Numpy in your Python IDE ([Integrated Development Environment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_development_environment)), you need to *import* them first as `import pandas as pd ` and `import numpy as np `.
