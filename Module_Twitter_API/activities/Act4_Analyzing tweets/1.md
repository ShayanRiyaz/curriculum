Let's start by setting up Pandas and Numpy. If you don't have these installed, you'll have to run the following commands.

```bash
pip install Pandas
pip install Numpy
```

And then, In order to use Pandas and Numpy in your Python IDE ([Integrated Development Environment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_development_environment)), you need to *import* them first as `import pandas as pd ` and `import numpy as np `.
