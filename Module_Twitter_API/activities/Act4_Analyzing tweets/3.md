<h1>Streaming our first tweets</h1>
So now that we have an API set up, we can start by streaming some tweets. So let's go ahead and create a variable called *tweets* that will store the data we'll be obtaining from the client that we just created. We'll use a inbuilt function, **user_timeline** to stream or retrieve from Twitter the tweets(think of a user's timeline as their homepage where they all their tweets from the people they follow). So let's go ahead and specify someone well known as the twitter handle and specify the number of tweets we need.

```python
tweets = api.user_timeline(screen_name="realDonaldTrump", count=20)
```

Now on printing `tweets`, we should get the most recent 20 tweets in JSON format. Looks spooooky! However, think of it as "raw‚Äù data (or a diamond in the roughüíé) which will analysis later on. The JSON formatting will actually come in handy later on as it will let us access data in logical manner. Meaning Python will call for a specific piece data by name (like  this ` ingredients["burger"]`) and it will give you it data (like `["meat","buns","lettuce","condiments‚Äù]`) like an array! How cool is that!
