Let's start by setting up the twitter API. Firstly, let's setup a function inside our `TwitterClient` class that will return the API. Remeber, we are not adding object orientated features to make our life harder, these abstractions or high-level calls and methods will make our code readable and easy to extend or add on to, especiallt when we start with bigger and more complex data sets.This will help us understand what we are doing more clearly later on. We do so as follows:

```python
def get_twitter_client_api(self):
        return self.twitter_client
```

Next, let's create a twitter client which we'll use to analyze the tweet data of the user we'll be specifying that we'll be receiving in JSON format(which is just a useful and standardized way to store our data). We'll start by removing the existing code inside the main portion of our file and create an object of the `TwitterClient()` class called `twitter_client`. 

```python
twitter_client = TwitterClient()
```

<<<<<<< HEAD
<<<<<<< HEAD
Now let's get the API through the function we just created and store it inside a variable for analyzing in the future. With this object we will be able to access the other and fundamental parts of our class (i.e methods that actually modify and manipulate our tweets).

```python
api = twitter_client.get_twitter_client_api()
```


=======
Now on printing `tweets`, we should get the most recent 20 tweets in JSON format. Looks spooooky! However, think of it as "raw” data (or a diamond in the rough💎) which will analysis later on. The JSON formatting will actually come in handy later on as it will let us access data in logical manner. Meaning Python will call for a specific piece data by name (like  this ` ingredients["burger"]`) and it will give you it data (like `["meat","buns","lettuce","condiments”]`) like an array! How cool is that!
