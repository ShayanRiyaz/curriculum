#### Accessing Data

Now to the reason why we use JSON: it allows us to interface with our data in a very simple way. 

Remember we access an array by giving the index or address of the value we want to access.  In JSON we do the same thing but this time we can give it anything as an index (as long as it is a valid key)!

```json
{
	"Name" : "John Smith",
	"Age" : 23,
	"College" : "UC Redding",
	"Favorite Colleges" : ["UC Redding", "UC Santa Rosa" , "UC San Jose"],
}
```

If we want John's age all we need to do is load the JSON values into a variable like `John_Data` and make the following access : ` John_Data["Age"]`.

#### Nesting

The final topic we will discuss here is nesting - yes you can have JSON in yo' JSON.

Here is an example:

```
{
	"Fruits": {
		"Favorites" : ["Apples","Oranges"],
    	"Dislike" : ["Banana","Pineapple"]
	},
}
```

The way you would access them is quiet similar to what you say above(but with layers this time). You load it into a variable called Food. And access the `Dislike`s like this: `Food["Fruits"]["Dislike"]`

#### Finishing Up

Recall that we store our tweet data in groups like by text, source,etc. So it only makes sense to use a data storage format that complements this: JSON.
