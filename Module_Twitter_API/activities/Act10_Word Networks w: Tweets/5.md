## Getting Tweets

Let's grab 1000 recent tweets on the topic of climate change.

```python
search_term = "#climate+change -filter:retweets"

tweets = tw.Cursor(api.search,
                   q=search_term,
                   lang="en",
                   since='2018-11-01').items(1000)
```
First, we want to decide some key words what's called a search term to use to narrow down data that we'll be getting from Twitter. Then, we're using the Cursor* object from Tweepy to help us search for 1000 tweets starting from November 1, 2018 about climate change. You can also try a more recent day if you'd like but for this example, we will be using November 1, 2018.

It will also make sure that tweets we get will be in English. If you want tweets in another language, you'll want to type in another acronym for it. All this information will be stored in ``tweets`` as a list. 

*Cursor is Tweepy's way of going through "pages" of their user data (pagination). 

Next, add this code:
```python
def remove_url(txt):
    """Replace URLs found in a text string with nothing 
    (i.e. it will remove the URL from the string).

    Parameters
    ----------
    txt : string
        A text string that you want to parse and remove urls.

    Returns
    -------
    The same txt string with url's removed.
    """

    return " ".join(re.sub("([^0-9A-Za-z \t])|(\w+:\/\/\S+)", "", txt).split())
```

This code is actually a function we named ``remove_url``. It will take a string you give it as the areguement, ``txt``, then clean it up but taking out any symbols that are't English letters. We will use this function to help us easier extract bigrams later.
