# Connecting Our Classes in Main

Now that we have made the **TwitterStreamer** and the **StdOutListener** class, we will now incorporate them together to have working code. 

1. In that main function, you will create a hash_tag_list of the specific keywords that you want to search within tweets. You can enter any keyword that you want in the quotation marks.

```python
hash_tag_list = [""]
```

2. Next, you will create the text file to where all the tweet data will be stored. You can name that **tweets.txt** to the fetched_tweets_filename variable.

```python
fetched_tweets_filename = "tweets.txt"
```

3. Furthermore, you will a Twitter streamer object using the **TwitterStreamer** class and the **stream_tweets** function in that class. You will pass in the fetched_tweets_filename and hash_tag_list arguments that you just made.

```python
twitter_streamer = TweeterStreamer()
twitter_streamer.stream_tweets(fetched_tweets_filename, hash_tag_list)
```

Here what your main function should look like in your **tweepy_streamer.py** file.

```python
if __name__ == "__main__":
	hash_tag_list = [""]
  fetched_tweets_filename = "tweets.txt"
  
  twitter_streamer = TweeterStreamer()
  twitter_streamer.stream_tweets(fetched_tweets_filename, hash_tag_list)
```

With that, when you run your **tweepy_streamer.py** file on terminal, you will see the tweet data corresponding to your keywords in hash_tag_list appear in your **tweets.txt** file. You have officially finished streaming live tweets from Twitter onto a file on your computer.



Here is what your live tweet should look similar to if you run it in your terminal.
