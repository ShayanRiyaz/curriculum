<!--title={Formatting Our Dataframe}-->

Let’s make a data frame!

Add the following code:

```python
tweets = pd.DataFrame()
tweets['text'] = list(map(lambda tweet: tweet['text'], tweets_data))
tweets['Username'] = list(map(lambda tweet: tweet['user']['screen_name'], tweets_data))
tweets['Timestamp'] = list(map(lambda tweet: tweet['created_at'], tweets_data))
print(tweets.head())
```
This block of code creates our dataframe and will display the tweet, the username, and when the tweet was made. As we are extracting data with the combo of lambda, map, and list and setting it to something like tweets[“user”], we will get a column of users in our data frame. We can only do this because the file was formatted in JSON! Doesn't JSON make everything seem simple?

pd.DataFrame() is a function from pandas that will make a new data frame object, in our case, a data frame named tweets. 

Remember how we turned our data file to a JSON format?  We’re going to extract contents from it now!

##### list(map(lambda)

Lambda - makes an in-place function without using *def fun*
Map (in this context) - runs lambda on every tweets in tweets data
List (in this context) - forms of the map in a list

### Final Output

Save and run your file! You should see something like so appear in you command line:

Although we set a maximum amount of tweets we want in our code, the amount actually can vary from 0-max_tweets depending on how long you let it run and how fast your computer is so don't worry if it has less than max tweets!
