<!--title={Retrieving Data Pt.1}-->

Hypothetically, we only wanted a certain sample size of 100 tweets for our research project. We can actually modify our code in order to limit the number of tweets we want to download. 

We can use an if-else statement that counts the number of tweets weâ€™ve downloaded and stops when we exceed a certain number.

```python
class StdOutListener(StreamListener):
  	def on_data(self, data):
    	global tweet_count
    	global max_tweets
    	global stream
    	if tweet_count < max_tweets:
      	print(data)
      	tweet_count += 1
      	return True
    	else:
      	stream.disconnect()
  	def on_error(self, status):
    	print(status)
```

`tweets_count` will be a counter used to track the number of tweets we've gotten so far by incrementing by 1 after every data read. `max_tweets` will be indicating the maximum amount of tweets there will be in our sample.
