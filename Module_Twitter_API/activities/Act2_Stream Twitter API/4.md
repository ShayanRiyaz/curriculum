##### Access Token Variables

Using any API will require authentication. This is where the API Keys and access token we received earlier comes in handy. Lets create four variables to store the values of our access token.

```python
access_token = your access token here    			
access_token_secret = your access token secret here
consumer_key = your customer key here
consumer_secret = your customer secret here
```

The tokens you received in your developer account will come into play when we want data from Twitter.

As with all API's, authentication and authorization are important. This is so APIs knows who is accessing their information and what privileges to provide. 

Now we're going to get into making a class to help us download tweets!

```python
class StdOutListener(StreamListener):
  def on_data(self, data):
    print(data)
    return True
  def on_error(self, status):
    print(status)
```
This is a simple class that can help us retrieve
