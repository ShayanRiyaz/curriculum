<!--titile={Reading Data}--> 

Now that we have a class set up to retrieve data, let's learn how to read it!

Currently our data is in a text file but we want the data in JSON file. The following loop accomplishes this task. 

```python
tweet_count = 0
max_tweets = 10

if __name__ == '__main__':
  tweets_data = []
  tweets_file = open(tweets_data_path, "r")
  for line in tweets_file:
    try:
      tweet = json.loads(line)
      tweets_data.append(tweet)
    except:
      continue
```
The code above reads from a file and turns all your data from just lines of informations into a JSON file.We want to use a JSON file because itâ€™s a very easy format to access your data and it organizes it into very nice sections. 

`tweets_count` and `max_tweets` are variables used in the StdOutListener class. It needs to be defined before we use the class. The counter should always start from 0. In this case, we'll have 10 maximum tweets.
