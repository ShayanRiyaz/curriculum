**Requesting Authorization**

```python
tracklist = ['#coronavirus, #virus, #CDC']

if __name__ == '__main__':
  	l = StdOutListener()
  	auth = OAuthHandler(consumer_key, consumer_secret)
  	auth.set_access_token(access_token, access_token_secret)
  	stream = Stream(auth, l)
  	stream.filter(track=tracklist)
```
OAuthHandler will take your secret API key and consumer key and authenticate your account.

Then with access, we can run the Streaming API by using Stream() so we can get data from Twitter.

Tracklist is the specific keywords you want to receive data for from Twitter. 

- Can be a list of of whatever #â€™s you like

##### Accessing Data

Now that we have set up our Authentication and gathered our data, what we need to do now is view the data. Run it and pipe it to a .txt file in command line. Piping is file redirection where content of one file goes into other. Data in the file on the left gets copied to the file on the right

Open your command line. Go to the directory that holds you code file. Once your there, type:

 twitter_data.py > twitter_data.txt

Let this run. It's going to take while but let it run for a good amount of time.

When it's running, it will be collecting data into our **twitter_data.text** file in JSON format. **twitter_data.text** will be a file that the code makes in the same folder as where the code file is.

If you are curious, do open the text file and check it out. It's actually really cool.
