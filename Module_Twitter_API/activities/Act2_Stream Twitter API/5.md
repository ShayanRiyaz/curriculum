# Accessing Data

Now that we have set up our authentication and gathered our data, what we need to do now is view the data. 

Open your Command Prompt/Terminal. Go to the directory that holds you code file. Once you are there, type:

`twitter_data.py > twitter_data.txt`

This statement "pipes" all of the output from your Python program into a text file. Normally when you run `twitter_data.py`, the output would just print to the screen. By piping your output to another file, the output will just print to the file instead, giving you the ability to collect tweets directly from Twitter in real-time!

You should let this run for a little while to accumulate a bunch of tweets. When it's running, it will be collecting data into our **twitter_data.txt** file in JSON format. **twitter_data.txt** will be a file that the code makes in the same folder as where the code file is.

Now close your terminal and open the text file, you should see a bunch of topical tweets!
