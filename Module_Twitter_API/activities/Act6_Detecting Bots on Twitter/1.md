## Detecting Bots

Before get straight into the meat of this activity, we need to ask ourselves: what exactly are bots(in the realm of programming)?

Think of a bot as a program that runs independantly and continously until it finishes its task.For example, a bot on Twitter would be an account run by a non-human program tweeting, liking, and retweeting posts.

Let's learn to find possible bots on Twitter! 

In the same file that you did the last activity, type this code:

```python
print("There are {} different users".format(tweets['Username'].nunique()) 
```

This snippet of code will collect data of unique users from Twitter and tell you the number of of unique users there are. The Username dataframe is from your the last activity, Visualizing Twitter Trends. When ran, you will see something print like "There are 58932 different users" on your terminal.
