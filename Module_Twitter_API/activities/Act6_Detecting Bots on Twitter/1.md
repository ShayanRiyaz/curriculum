## Detecting Bots

Before get straight into the meat of this activity, we need to ask ourselves: what exactly are bots(in the realm of programming)?

Think of a bot as a program that runs independently and continuously until it finishes its task. For example, a bot on Twitter would be an account run by a non-human program tweeting, liking, and retweeting posts.

Let's learn to find possible bots on Twitter! 

This following snippet of code will ask Twitter how many unique users there are and ,in turn, gives you access to this number. The *Username* column in this data frame is from your last activity, **Visualizing Twitter Trends**. When run, you will see something print like "There are 58932 different users" on your terminal. 

```python
print("There are {} different users".format(tweets['Username'].nunique()) 
```

This information will give us a good picture of how many robots dwell amongst us later on!
