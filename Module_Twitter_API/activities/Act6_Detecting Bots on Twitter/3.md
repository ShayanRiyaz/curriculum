## Taking Top 25 Users

Lets say we are lazy and don't want to scan a list of hundreds of users for the people who tweet/retweet the most?

Well, we can just let our code do all the work! In this case, let's say we only want to see the top 25 people. 

The following code snippet will sort  the top 25 most active users in descending order and save them to the variable ` top_users`. 

```
top_users = usertweets.count(['text'].sort_values(ascending = False))[:25] 
```

We then convert the top_users list into a dictionary (i.e a key-value pair). But notice key-value pair here is that the number of tweets is the key and the value is the user(if there a re multiple users with the same tweet number then we associate a tweet count to the newest/latest user we find in our list).

```
top_users_dict = top_users.to_dict() 
```

Next, we use the [sorted()](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/sorted-function-python/) function from Python to organize the items in the dictionary. Setting the key argument to `lambda x:x[1]` sorts values of each item based on the value of key.

```python
user_ordered_dict = sorted(top_users_dict.items(), key=lambda x:x[1])
```

Finally, we reverse our sorted dictionary so that we can have our most active users at the start.

```
user_ordered_dict = user_ordered_dict[::-1]
```
