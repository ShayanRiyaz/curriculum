# Importing Necessary Libraries

Now that our data is collected, we will now prepare the data. **Create a new Python script/file before proceeding.**

We'll start by importing the libraries that are needed for the analysis and visualization:

```python
# Import all the needed libraries
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import json
import seaborn as sns
import re
import collections
from wordcloud import WordCloud
```

We have already went over `pandas`, `numpy`, `json`, `re`, and `wordcloud` in previous activities. 

Here is an explanation of the remaining three:

* `matplotlib.pyplot` - A very important package that greatly simplifies producing **interactive plots in Python**.
* `seaborn` - similar to Matplotlib, but helps generate more pretty visualizations
* `collections` - allows for data to be stored in alternatives to your standard Pythonlists and sets
