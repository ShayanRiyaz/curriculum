In today's activity, we are going to retrieve raw Twitter data to create cool visualizations using the Twitter Streaming API. In the second activity "Stream Twitter API", you should have learned how to download tweet data using the Streaming API. From that activity, you should have created a tweet downloading script. (please reference Part 1 of Activity 2 before proceeding).

You should already have your code look like this:

```python
class StdOutListener(StreamListener):
  def on_data(self, data):
    print(data)
    return True
  def on_error(self, status):
    print(status)

# Create tracklist with the words that will be searched for- pick your own!
tracklist = []

# Handles Twitter authentication and the connection to Twitter Streaming API
if __name__ == '__main__':
  l = StdOutListener()
  auth = OAuthHandler(consumer_key, consumer_secret)
  auth.set_access_token(access_token, access_token_secret)
  stream = Stream(auth, l)
  stream.filter(track=tracklist)
```

Please set your tracklist to a list of hashtags you want to process tweets for:

```python
tracklist = ['#HASHTAG1', '#HASHTAG2', '#HASHTAG3']
```

Once the script is ready, just like in Activity 2, run the script and pipe its output to a .txt file in this manner:

**Twitter_Downloader.py > twitter_data.txt**

Leave it running for a while, and thatâ€™s it, you have your tweets, ready to be analyzed!
