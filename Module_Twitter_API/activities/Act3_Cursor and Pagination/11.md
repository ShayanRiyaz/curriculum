# Using a Cursor to get a Friend List

We can add the following functions to our `TwitterClient` definition to get a number of friends of a user from Twitter:

```python
    def get_friend_list(self, num_friends):
        friend_list = []
        for friend in Cursor(self.twitter_client.friends, id=self.twitter_user).items(num_friends):
            friend_list.append(friend)
        return friend_list
```

We define a Cursor object to be able to obtain a list of a user's friends. (notice the usage of `self.twitter_client.friends`, just like how we used `self.twitter_client.user_timeline`.) Just like when we were getting user timeline tweets, the `items` attribute allows us to iterate through our friends. We can also pass in a parameter `num_friends` to define a number of friends needed. We keep track of a friend list, append each friend to this list, and return it.

```python
    def get_home_timeline_tweets(self, num_tweets):
        home_timeline_tweets = []
        for tweet in Cursor(self.twitter_client.home_timeline, 			   id=self.twitter_user).items(num_tweets):
            home_timeline_tweets.append(tweet)
        return home_timeline_tweets
```

This pattern is very similar to the previous method to get a friend list.
