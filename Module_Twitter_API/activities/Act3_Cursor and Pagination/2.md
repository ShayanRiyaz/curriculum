# Making Authentication into Its Own Class

![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d2/Oauth_logo.svg/180px-Oauth_logo.svg.png)

Now let's abstract the Authentication into its own class so that we can use it to authenticate for other purposes in this activity. Abstraction makes our code still human readable even though we are doing some very complex things in the background. 

First, we are going to do some changes to the code we wrote in **tweepy_streamer.py**:

- Change ```class StdOutListener(StreamListener)``` to ```class TwitterListener(StreamListener)```

- Remember to also change the function call also (Ex: ``` listener = StdOutListener(fetched_tweets_filename)``` to ``` listener = TwitterListener(fetched_tweets_filename)```)

- We are also going to abstract the authentication into its own class:

  ```python
  # # # # TWITTER AUTHENTICATER # # # #
  class TwitterAuthenticator():
  
      def authenticate_twitter_app(self):
          auth = OAuthHandler(twitter_credentials.CONSUMER_KEY, twitter_credentials.CONSUMER_SECRET)
          auth.set_access_token(twitter_credentials.ACCESS_TOKEN, twitter_credentials.ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET)
          return auth
  ```

- We are also going to change some of the things in the  ```TwitterStreamer()``` class since we moved the authentication into its own class:

  ```python
  def __init__(self):
          self.twitter_autenticator = TwitterAuthenticator()  
  ```
  
  * The above setups our authentication (i.e shows Twitter our credentials, which in turn allow us to use their services).
  
  ```python
      def stream_tweets(self, fetched_tweets_filename, hash_tag_list):
  ```
  
  * We declare a function called "stream_tweets" which is part of the **TwitterAuthenticator** class. It accepts a file name (where will be depositing our found tweets) and a hash tag list(which holds the hash tags we need to use to find said tweets).
  
```python
  		listener = TwitterListener(fetched_tweets_filename)
          auth = self.twitter_autenticator.authenticate_twitter_app() 
          stream = Stream(auth, listener)
```

  * â€‹    The above lines:
    * Give the API a file so it can put tweets on a file in your computer.
    * We authenticate ourselves.
    * And we finally, crack open a stream and prepare to filter it with our hash tag list...which we will do in the next step.

  ```python
          # This line filter Twitter Streams to capture data by the keywords: 
          stream.filter(track=hash_tag_list)
  ```

  * This line filter Twitter Streams to capture data by the keywords.

  > Here, we changed the init fucntions to the class. We also changed auth = self.twitter_autenticator.authenticate_twitter_app()  within the stream_tweets class method
