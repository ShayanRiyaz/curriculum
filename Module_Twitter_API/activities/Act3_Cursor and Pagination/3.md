# Rate limiting

Twitter API has a rate limit. Rate limiting of the standard API is primarily on a per-user basis â€” or more accurately described, per user access token. If a method allows for 15 requests per rate limit window, then it allows 15 requests per window per access token.

When using application-only authentication, rate limits are determined globally for the entire application. If a method allows for 15 requests per rate limit window, then it allows you to make 15 requests per window. If we go over this limit, twitter will throw error code 420 for making too many requests and we might be locked out of the access information.

This is why it is worthwhile to check that the status message you are receiving is not an error message. Therefore, we are going to change the ```on_error(self, status)``` function to handle a rate limit error:

```python
def on_error(self, status):
  if status == 420:
    # Returning False on_data method in case rate limit occurs
    return False
```

Rate limiting is regularly used to regulate the traffic on a network and it has many other uses as well. By limiting the traffic, it results in a better flow of data and increases the security of the network by protecting from attacks like DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service). In this case, the limit of requests for data is limited to 15 per user token.
