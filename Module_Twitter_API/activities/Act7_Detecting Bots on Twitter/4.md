## Getting Our User Data

Now we're just going to make 2 lists, one for the usernames and one with values. This will hold the information separately so we can use it for plotting our information later on. 

The following code will create `dic_keys` (a list that will hold usernames) and `dict_values` (which will hold values of that user).

```python	
	dict_keys = [] 
	dict_values = [] 
```

This following snippet of code will loop through the dictionary of data from 0 to 25(i.e the top 25 msot active users). While it loops through the top 25 users, it will extract their username and tweet/retweet count and put them in `dict_keys` and `dict_values`, respectively. 

```python
for item in user_ordered_dict[0:25]: 
		dict_keys.append(item[0])  
		dict_values.append(item[1])  
```

We will use this info in the coming slide to construct a graph to showcase our findings!
