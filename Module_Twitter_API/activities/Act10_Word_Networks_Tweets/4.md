## Twitter Authentication

In order to be able to get Twitter data, you must have to use your Twitter developer account. 

You have have made one from the very first activities set. Go onto the website and please log-in to get your personal access code. 

Add this:
	
	consumer_key= 'yourkeyhere'
	consumer_secret= 'yourkeyhere'
	access_token= 'yourkeyhere'
	access_token_secret= 'yourkeyhere'

	auth = tw.OAuthHandler(consumer_key, consumer_secret)
	auth.set_access_token(access_token, access_token_secret)
	api = tw.API(auth, wait_on_rate_limit=True)

Here, we're just going to get make variables to hold your keys so the code looks nicer.
