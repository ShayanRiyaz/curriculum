## Introduction to N-grams


So if we have a sentence, how can the computer know exactly what it means? 
	
For humans, we can tell because we understand the language and know the different definition but the computer isn't like us and that's why we have and use n-grams in NLP (natural language processing).

N-grams help the computer use surrounding context to figure out what exactly what the words mean. In this activity, we'll learn about bigrams, a type of n-gram.

## N-gram Models

With the understanding of how N-grams work, we'll now talk about the models. N-grams models are built with n-grams. 

Models use the N-1 previous words to predict the occurrence of a word in a phrase or sentence.

Say we have a bigram, then it's 2-1=1. The computer will use the previous word. In a trigram, it's 3-1=2 so the computer will the the previous 2 words.
