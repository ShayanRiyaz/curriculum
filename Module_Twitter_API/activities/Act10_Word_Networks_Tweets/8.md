<!--title="Exploring Co-occurance (Bigrams) Pt.2"-->

## Bigrams frequency

Want to know which bigrams appear the most in your list of tweets? 

We can use a Counter object to take the bigrams as dictionary keys and their counts are as dictionary values.

Add this code:

```python
bigrams = list(itertools.chain(*terms_bigram))
bigram_counts = collections.Counter(bigrams)
bigram_counts.most_common(20)
```

Here, we will be flattening our list of bigrams. Flattening will remove the brackets on the list of bigrams allow work to be done on it, in this case using a counter. 

We'll be using the ``chain()`` function from itertools library. ``chain()`` function will treat consecutive sequences as a single sequence. 

Then ``collections.Counter`` create Counter object from the Collections library that stores elements as dictionary keys, and their counts are stored as dictionary values with your list of flattened bigrams.

Next, ``most_common`` function will be used on the Counter object to sort the like from the most occuring bigrams to the least and print out the top 20.  Run your programt should look something like this:
