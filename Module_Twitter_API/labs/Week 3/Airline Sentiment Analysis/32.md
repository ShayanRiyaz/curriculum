<!--title={Retrieving Tweets for produce_dataframe()}-->

<!--concepts={indexingDataframes.mdx}-->

Now that we've created our Dataframe, we need to fill our dataframe. Recall the parameter `search_dict` is a dictionary that has a {key, value} pair in the items category. The `key` is the date you will be searching for, and the `value` is the name of the airline you will search for. 



After producing the dataframe you should have iterated through the `search_dict` and call  the `tweepy.Cursor()` object to get the tweets with the search query and iterate through the tweets to find the sentiments.



We also want to keep track of how many of each sentiments you have. Make sure to initialize the number of sentiments of each 'positive', 'neutral' or 'negative' first. 



You need to use the `TextBlob` module to get the `sentiment.polarity` attribute. For each item in the Tweets we have, set the item in the dataframe date to the sentiment.
