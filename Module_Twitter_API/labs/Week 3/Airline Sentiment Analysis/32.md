<!--title={Sentiment Analysis for produce_dataframe()}-->

<!--concepts={indexingDataframes.mdx}-->

In our `Cursor` object is a list of tweets with our search query. 

Iterate through this cursor object and find whether its sentiment is positive, neutral or negative.

* You'll have to use `TextBlob` as well as the `sentiment.polarity` attribute.

Keep track of a list that will contain the sentiment ratings 'positive', 'neutral' or 'negative'. For each tweet, make sure you append the tweet's sentiment.

When done iterating through the tweets, index the dataframe so that the sentiment data shows up in your dataframe. 

The function should return `df`.
