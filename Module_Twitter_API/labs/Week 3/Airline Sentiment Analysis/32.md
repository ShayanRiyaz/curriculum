<!--title={Retrieving Tweets for produce_dataframe()}-->

<!--concepts={indexingDataframes.mdx}-->

Now that we've created our Dataframe, we need to fill our dataframe. Recall the parameter `search_dict` is a dictionary that has a {key, value} pair in the items category. The `key` is the date you will be searching for, and the `value` is the name of the airline you will search for. 



After producing the dataframe you should iterate through the `search_dict` and call  the `tweepy.Cursor()` object to get the tweets with the search query.
