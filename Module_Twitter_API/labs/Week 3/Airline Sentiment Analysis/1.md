<!--title={Introduction}-->

For this lab, we will be conducting sentiment analysis on specific US airlines. **Sentiment Analysis** is the analysis of language to identify emotions (positive, negative, etc). 

To perform sentiment analysis we'll be gathering tweets referencing airlines using Twitter's API as well as the `tweepy` and `TextBlob` packages to determine whether generated tweets have a positive, neutral or negative attitude towards the airline in question. Then we'll graph that information, both in the form of a bar and line graph.

Twitter presence is an important point of emphasis for companies. Twitter users can quickly form a positive or negative opinion of company, depending on what users are tweeting pertaining to companies. Companies perform sentiment analysis frequently to gauge what Twitter's opinion of their company is, and what steps they can take to ensure a positive Twitter presence for their company. We'll conduct an elementary sentiment analysis that companies may conduct for this lab, this is an example of what you should be making by the end:
