<!--title={Getting the tweets for the time series dataframe}-->

We can search for the tweets related to an airline the same way we did before. The only thing we're changing here is we're picking on airline to search for instead of all of the airlines in the search dictionary. 

```python
tweets = tw.Cursor(api.search,
                      q="united airlines",
                      lang="en",
                      since=date_since).items(1000)
```

Again, we're getting a list of tweets through the Tweepy cursor object. 



In the background, the Tweepy cursor object is creating a loop that uses your API keys to get up to 1000 tweets as we set it with the parameter.
