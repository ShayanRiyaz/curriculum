# Introduction

With the wealth of information at our disposal, American politics have increasingly become a game of misinformation and narrative twisting. To win elections, often times it doesn't matter what political candidates actually do or say, but how candidates can control the narrative surrounding their campaigns, and what the American people think of their candidates. 

Twitter reactions are a valuable source of political opinions from regular Americans, because anyone can tweet their honest feelings about political candidates. Using sentiment analysis on Americans' tweets can give us genuine insight on the sentiment behind every candidate in the race, outside of media spin or campaign biases. For this lab, we'll dive into the tweets during and after the 7th Democratic Debate to gauge how average Americans perceive political candidates, and graph our results in a stacked bar graph! Here is what the result should look like:

To do this, we'll be gathering tweets referencing political candidates using Twitter's API as well as the `tweepy` and `TextBlob`packages to determine whether generated tweets have a positive, neutral or negative attitude towards the airlines.

Proceed to Twitter Developer [here](https://developer.twitter.com/en/apps), and you'll need to make a new Twitter app and get four credentials for future use: consumer key, consumer token, access token and access secret token. 

Paste those credentials into the appropriate area in your starter code.
