<!--title={Keys and Tokens}-->

After creating your app, head to its “Keys and tokens” section, where you will find an API key and API secret key. Copy these keys for later use. (these keys in the picture have been erased)

Below the consumer API keys, there is also an area to generate an access token and access secret token, please generate them and keep track of those as well. Remember, these keys will be used to access Twitter's sentiment anlysis API and will be inserted into the starter code.
