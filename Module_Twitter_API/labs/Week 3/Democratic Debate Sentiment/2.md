<!--title={Authentication}-->

So far we have created a twitter developer account and an application. We will next use our the keys and tokens that have been automatically generated to continue creating our API.

We will need to paste the keys and tokens in the allocated space. Then configure OAuth authentication with your consumer key and secret, set your access tokens and create a API object in `tweepy` to fetch tweets. After the authentication process, we should have access to data on twitter.

Bear in mind we will be using the `dem_search` dictionary for the rest of this lab.
