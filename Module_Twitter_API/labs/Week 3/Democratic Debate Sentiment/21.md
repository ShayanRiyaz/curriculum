<!--title={Authentication}-->

Paste your keys and tokens in the allocated space. You'll want to authenticate in three steps:

1. Configure OAuth authentication with your consumer key and secret with the `OAuthHandler(consumer_key, consumer_secret)` call. This should create an `auth` object
  
    By configuring OAuth authentication, it allows API client app to access a user's twitter account without having to handle or store the user's login info.

2. Set your access tokens with `auth.set_access_token()`. 
  
    Setting the access tokens gives us authorization to a specific application that will give us access to specific parts of a user's data
 
3. Create a API object in `tweepy` to fetch tweets: `tweepy.API(auth, wait_on_rate_limit=True)`
  
    This function will return the tweets.
