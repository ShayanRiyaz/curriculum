# Graphing

Now that we have our dataframe with the number of positive, neutral, and negative tweets for each candidate, it's time to graph!

Inside of the function `produce_graph(df, keys)`, create a stacked bar graph, with each bar labelled with the number of the positive/neutral/negative tweets. Data presentation is everything - without putting your due diligence into your presentation, less people will read your analytics! So make sure your graph is properly titled, with a legend, x-axes, y-axes, and x and y labels. 

Here are some formatting rules (and hints!) that were used in the graph below: 

* Width of bars is 0.40
* The legend is placed outside the graph using `bbox_to_anchor`
* 0.1 inch margin between x-axis labels
* Think about what `matplotlib` function you would use to set up a bar graph. How would you set up bars so that the bottom of one bar is set at the same location as the top of another?
* You can set up text labels by initializing a figure `fig` with `plt.figure`, then initializing a subplot `ax` with `fig.add_subplot` and adding text labels at a location `(x, y)` with `ax.text(x, y, ...)`

Remember that this is the result you are aiming for:
