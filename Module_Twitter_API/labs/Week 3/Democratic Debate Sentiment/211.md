<!--title={Consumer keys, secrets and access tokens}-->

Remember all those credentials you generated? Paste them appropriately in the starter code.

We will need to add the following information in our code so we could retrieve the tweets!

```python
consumer_key = 'xxx'
consumer_secret = 'xxx'
access_token = 'xxx'
access_token_secret = 'xxx'
```

A comsumer key is the API key that provides the consumer with a certain service. This will provide the consumers the key that identifies them as the consumer.

The consumer secret is the consumer's "password" that is used and also the onsumer key. These two information will be used
to request access to a user's resources from twitter.

An access token is given to the consumer once they have completed the authorization. This token is provided by the service provider and will determine what access benefits that consumer will recieve over a particular user's resources. When the consumer wants to access data, they will need to provide the access token when requesting the information.
