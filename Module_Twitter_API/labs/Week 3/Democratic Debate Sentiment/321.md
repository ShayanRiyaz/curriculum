<!--title={Sentiment Analysis with TextBlob}-->

<!--concepts={indexingDataframes.mdx}-->

For each tweet object in the cursor, we can use the `.text` attribute to get the text of the tweet itself. Then for each text, we make a `TextBlob` object out of that text. 

From there, simply check the values of the `.sentiment.polarity` attribute. Positive polarity indicates positive sentiment, zero polarity indicates neutral sentiment and neutral polarity indicates negative sentiment. 

We keep track of positive, neutral and negative tweets with counter variables. At the end, we add the acquired sentiment data to the dataframe. 

Return `df` at the end.

```python
for key, val in search_dict.items():
	# ...
    
    positive = 0
    neutral = 0
    negative = 0
    for t in tweets:    
        analysis = TextBlob(t.text)
        if analysis.sentiment.polarity > 0:
            positive += 1  
        elif analysis.sentiment.polarity == 0:  
            neutral += 1  
        else:       
            negative += 1
        df[key] = [positive, neutral, negative]
return df
```
