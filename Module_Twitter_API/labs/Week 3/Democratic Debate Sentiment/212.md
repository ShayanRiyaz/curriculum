<!--title={The auth object}-->

We are now going to authenticate using our app credentials. Please look at the next two lines of code:

```python
auth = OAuthHandler(consumer_key, consumer_secret)
```

This line generates an authentication object using our consumer key and secret.

```python
auth.set_access_token(access_token, access_token_secret)
```

This line enables access to our authentication object with our access token and access secret token.

A comsumer key is different from an access token because this key is what differentiates the user as a consumer.
An access token on the other hand provides the consumers the access the user's resources. There are both essential to an API 
because it will determine if the user is a consumer and when they need to access data, they need to have
an access key or token.

Once you have authenticated the credentials, we will begin creating the start code!
