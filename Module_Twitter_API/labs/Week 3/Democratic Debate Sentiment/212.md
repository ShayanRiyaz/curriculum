<!--title={The auth object}-->

We are now going to authenticate using our app credentials. Please look at the next two lines of code:

```python
auth = OAuthHandler(consumer_key, consumer_secret)
```

This line generates an authentication object using our consumer key and secret.

```python
auth.set_access_token(access_token, access_token_secret)
```

This line enables access to our authentication object with our access token and access secret token.

A comsumer key is the API key that provides the consumer with a certain service. This will provide the consumers the key that
identifies them as the consumer.

An access token is given to the consumer once they have completed the authorization. This token is provided by the service provider
and will determine what access benefits that consumer will recieve over a particular user's resources. When the consumer wants to access
data, they will need to provide the access token when requesting the information.

There are both essential to an API because it will determine if the user is a consumer and when they need to access data, they need to
an access key or token.

Once you have authenticated the credentials, we will begin creating the start code!
