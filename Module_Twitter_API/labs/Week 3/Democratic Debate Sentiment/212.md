<!--title={The auth object}-->

We are now going to authenticate using our app credentials. Please look at the next two lines of code:

```python
auth = OAuthHandler(consumer_key, consumer_secret)
```

This line generates an authentication object using our consumer key and secret.

```python
auth.set_access_token(access_token, access_token_secret)
```

This line enables access to our authentication object with our access token and access secret token.
