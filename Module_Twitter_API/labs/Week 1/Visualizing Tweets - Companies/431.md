<!--title={Creating A Data Frame Of Tweets}-->

### Step 1: Creating a Data Frame

Let's store the cleansed data into a dataframe:

```
bg3 = pd.DataFrame(bg2, columns = ['tweet'])
```

Note:

`pd.DataFrame()` takes many parameters: data, index, columns, dtype, and copy, but we will only need to use the data and columns parameters. `data` is the information we are passing in, in our case the cleansed tweets in bg2, and `columns` is the column labels to be shown in our table.



### Step 2: Print Them Out!

Let's print out `bg3` to make sure we have the data frame output that we want.
