### Step 1: Joining Tweets

Next, create a variable `text` that joins all the tweets in `bg3`, separated with a space:

```python
text = " ".join(tweet for tweet in bg3.tweet)
```

You can also do it this way:

```python
for tweet in bg3:
    text = ' '.join(tweet)
```



### Step 2: Setting WordCloud Parameters

We want to set the parameters in our WordCloud by doing the following:

```python
cloud = WordCloud(
	background_color = <your_preferred_color>,
	stopwords = stopwords,
	max_words = <your_preferred_max_words>,
	max_font_size = <your_preferred_max_size>,
	random_state = <your_preferred_value>)
```



### Step 3: Creating the WordCloud

After that, we generate the WordCloud as follows:

```python
wordcloud = cloud.generate(str(text))
```
