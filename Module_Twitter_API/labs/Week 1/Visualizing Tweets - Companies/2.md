The next thing we want to do is to create a function to extract tweets. Define a function `get_tweets(username)` that obtains the tweets from the user with username indicated in the parenthesis.

In our `get_tweets(username)` function, we first get authorization to our consumer key and consumer secret by declaring the variable `auth` using the `tweepy.OAuthHandler` function imported from `tweepy`. Then, we want to access to the user's access key and access secret by using  the`auth.set_acess_token` function.

After we are done with that, we call the API by declaring the variable `api` using the `tweepy.API` function.
