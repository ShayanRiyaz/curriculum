Copy the information needed and create the following keys: `consumer_key`, `consumer_secret`, `access_token_key`, `access_token_secret`, and declare the keys as follows:

```python
consumer_key = '<your_consumer_key>'
consumer_secret = '<your_consumer_secret>'
access_token_key = '<your_access_token_key>'
access_token_secret = '<your_access_token_secret>'
```
