<!--title={Creating A Data Frame Of Tweets}-->

After we have obtained our cleansed tweets in `bg2`, we create a new variable `bg3` that makes `bg2` into a data frame using the `DataFrame` function from the `pandas` library. A DataFrame is a data structure with columns containing information. You can think of it like a spreadsheet. Print out `bg3` to check for the right data frame output.
