<!--title={Extracting Tweets Into .csv File}-->

For our next step, we want to obtain a number of tweets from the user and write it to a new csv file from the list of tweets.

To do that, we first declare an empty list and name it `tfile`. Then, create a for loop to access the items in `tweepy.Cursor()` and append tweet data into the `tfile` list. The information that we want to append into `tfile` are `username`, `tweet.id_str`, `tweet.source`, `tweet.created_at`, `tweet.retweet_count`, `tweet.favourite_count`, and `tweet.text.encode("utf-8")`.

Once we have all our data we need in our `tfile` list, we copy them into a new csv file. Declare a variable `outfile` that names our new .csv file. Copy the data from `tfile` into the .csv file by using the `open` and `writerow` functions.

Once we are done with this, we have completed our `get_tweet()` function and we can move on to define our main function.
