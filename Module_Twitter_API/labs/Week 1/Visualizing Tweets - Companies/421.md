<!--title={Creating A Data Frame Of Tweets}-->

After obtaining our cleansed tweets in `bg2`, we create a new variable `bg3` to form a data frame for `bg2` as follows:

```python
bg3 = pd.DataFrame(bg2, columns = ['tweet'])
```

Additionally, print out `bg3` to make sure we have the data frame output that we want.
