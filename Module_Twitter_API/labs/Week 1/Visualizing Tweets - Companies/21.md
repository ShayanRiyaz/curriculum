<!--title={Authorization Keys and Calling API}-->

Define a function called `get_tweet()` which takes the parameter `username`. Then, use `OAuthHandler()` to gain authorization to the consumer key and consumer secret by using the function `OAuthHandler()` from the `tweepy` library.

The next thing we want to do is to gain access to the access key and access secret. We do so by using the `set_access_token()` function on `auth`. 

Once we are done with the authorization procedure, we move on by calling the API by calling `tweepy.API()`.
