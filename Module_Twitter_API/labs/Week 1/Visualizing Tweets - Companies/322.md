<!--title={Copying Tweets To .csv File}-->

Open and write in the .csv file by using the following line of code:

```python
with open(outfile,'w+') as file:
```

Under the opened file, use the `csv.writer(file,delimeter)`function to specify how our data should be separated. In this case, we want them to be separated by a comma. Declare this function in a variable called `writer`.

Using `writer`, we want to write in our .csv file. To make our data tidy and easy to understand, we write the categories on the first row of the .csv file and then add the data from `tfile` in the rows below it as shown:

```python
writer.writerow(['User_Name','Tweet_ID','Source','Created_date','Retweet_count',
                 'Favourite_count','Tweet'])
writer.writerow(tfile)
```
