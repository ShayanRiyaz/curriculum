<!--title={Visualizing Tweets}-->

For this lab, we will be analyzing tweets using Twitter's API and `tweepy` package in Python by creating a Word Cloud to observe the frequency of words being used in a company's tweets.

Analyzing the words used by a company in an increasingly cluttered social media world has many uses. Companies use social media to generate excitement around their products and increase awareness of their company, so the words they choose in their tweets can provide lots of insight into the values of marketing strategies and values of companies on Twitter. How do companies advertise their products? How often do they attack the products of other companies? What kind of feelings are they trying to conjure in relation to their products?  Knowing the words used in their tweets, ordered by frequency, will help us paint a picture of a company's marketing on Twitter.

To do this in Python using `tweepy`, you should start off by importing our necessary libraries. The libraries we will be using are:

`tweepy`, `pandas`, `sys`, `csv`, `WordCloud` and `STOPWORDS` from `wordcloud`, `matplotlib`, `matplotlib.pyplot`, `string`, `re`, `PIL`

The next thing we want is to be able to use the python-twitter API client.  To do that, you need to acquire a declare a set of application tokens. Name the tokens `consumer_key`, `consumer_secret`, `access_token_key`, and `access_token_secret`.
