Our last main step is to create a Wordcloud based on the dataframe of cleansed tweets. We're really close now! 

To do that, use the functions from `matplotlib`, `WordCloud`, and `matplotlib.pyplot` libraries.

`matplotlib` is a plotting library for the Python programming language. It helps plotting in creating applications.

`WordCloud` is a visual representation of text data. It displays a list of words, the importance of each distinguished by font size or color.

`matplotlib.pyplot` is a collection of command style functions that make `matplotlib` work like MATLAB. Each `pyplot` function makes some change to a figure: ex: creates a figure, creates a plotting area in a figure, plots some lines in a plotting area, decorates the plot with labels, etc.

Here is the documentation for each of these libraries if you want additional information:

* [`matplotlib`](https://matplotlib.org/3.2.0/contents.html) 
* [`WordCloud`](https://amueller.github.io/word_cloud/)
* [`matplotlib.pyplot`](https://matplotlib.org/api/_as_gen/matplotlib.pyplot)

After creating the WordCloud, save the figure as well! You can then compile your entire code and you are done!
