To cleanse the data in `bg` and store it into another variable called `bg2`, we need to import the `re` library.

<<<<<<< HEAD
We define the patterns we want to clean by using `re.compile("<specific pattern>")`, and then we can cleanse the data by using `re.sub(pattern1, " ", tweet)` within a for loop.
=======

After we have obtained our cleansed tweets in `bg2`, we create a new variable `bg3` that makes `bg2` into a data frame using the `DataFrame` function from the `pandas` library. 

Check it by printing out `bg3` to check for the right data frame output.
