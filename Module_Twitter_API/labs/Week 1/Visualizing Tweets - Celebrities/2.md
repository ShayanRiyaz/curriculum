Now, let's start to get the tweets from the celebrity. To do this, we create a function to extract tweets. 

Define a function called `get_tweet()` which takes the parameter `username`. Then, gain authorization to the **consumer key** and **consumer secret**.

The next thing we want to do is to gain access to the **access key** and **access secret**.

Once we are done with the authorization procedure, we move on by calling the API.
