Now, let's start to get the tweets from the celebrity. To do this, we create a function to extract tweets. 

Define a function `get_tweets(username)` that obtains the tweets from the user with username indicated in the parenthesis.

In our `get_tweets(username)` function, we first get authorization to our **consumer key** and **consumer secret** by declaring the variable `auth` using the `tweepy.OAuthHandler` function imported from `tweepy`. Then, we want to access to the user's **access key** and **access secret** by using  the `auth.set_acess_token()` function.

After we are done with that, we call the API by declaring the variable `api` using the `tweepy.API` function.
