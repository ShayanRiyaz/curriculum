<!--title={Reading The .csv File Of Tweets}-->

Read the .csv file generated by the `get_tweets()` function by declaring a variable that calls the `read_csv()` function. The `read_csv()` function works like this:

```python
bg = pd.read_csv(<csv_filename>,encoding='utf-8')
```

Print the first `n` rows from your .csv file to make sure everything is going smoothly by using the `print()` and `head()` function like this:

```python
print(bg.head(n))
```

This will print out the first n items in `bg`.
