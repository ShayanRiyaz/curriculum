Our last main step is to create a Wordcloud based on the dataframe of cleansed tweets.

To do that, use the functions from `matplotlib`, `WordCloud`, and `matplotlib.pyplot` libraries. 

`matplotlib` is a plotting library for the Python programming language. It helps plotting in creating applications.

`WordCloud` is a visual representation of text data. It displays a list of words, the importance of each beeing shown with font size or color. 

`matplotlib.pyplot` is a collection of command style functions that make matplotlib work like MATLAB. Each `pyplot` function makes some change to a figure: e.g., creates a figure, creates a plotting area in a figure, plots some lines in a plotting area, decorates the plot with labels, etc.

After creating the WordCloud, save the figure as well!

After that, compile your entire code and you are done!
