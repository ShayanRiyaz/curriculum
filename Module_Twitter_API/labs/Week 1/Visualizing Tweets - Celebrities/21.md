<!--title={Authorization Keys and Calling API}-->

Define a function `get_tweets(username)` that obtains the tweets from the user with username indicated in the parenthesis.

In our `get_tweets(username)` function, we declare the variable `auth` using the `tweepy.OAuthHandler` function imported from `tweepy` to get authorization to our consumer key and consumer secret. 

Then, we access to the user's access key and access secret by using  the `auth.set_acess_token()` function.

After we are done with that, we call the API by declaring the variable `api` using the `tweepy.API` function.
