<!--title={Copying Tweets To .csv File}-->

Now we want to have our tweet data be in a .cvs file.

We can simply create a new empty .cvs file and copy all the tweet data we have obtained and stored in `tfile`.  



Before we write into the .cvs file, we need to create it by `open()` first:

```python
with open(filename,'w+') as file:
```

Then, we can copy the data from `tfile` to the by using the `writerows(tfile)` function.
