<!--title={Reading A .csv File}-->

Let's define a `main()` function and do the rest of our tasks there!

### Step 1: Generate the .cvs File 

In this function, we start by obtaining the tweet-filled .csv file with the specific username, using the `get_tweets()` function we previously defined.

### Step 2: Read the .cvs File and Check How It Goes!

To read the .csv file that we generated from the `get_tweets()` function, we declare a variable `bg` that calls the function `read_csv()` from the `pandas` library.

Check it by printing out the first 5 rows of data from `bg` using the `head()` function.
