<!--title={Reading A .csv File}-->

Let's define a `main()` function and do the rest of our tasks there!

### Step 1: Read the .cvs File

To read the .csv file that we generated from the `get_tweets()` function, we declare a variable `bg` that calls the function `read_csv()` from the `pandas` library.

### Step 2: Check How It Goes!

Check it by printing out the first 5 rows of data from `bg` using the `head()` function.
