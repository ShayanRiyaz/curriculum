Before we start to write the program obtaining tweets, we should be able to use the python-twitter API client first.

To do that, you need to acquire a declare a set of application tokens. Name the tokens `consumer_key`, `consumer_secret`, `access_token_key`, and `access_token_secret`.

First, Head over to your Twitter Developer Account and create an app. Fill out the fields on the next page that looks like this:

After your app is created, you will see a new page that shows all the information you need.

Copy the information needed and declare the keys as follows:

```python
consumer_key = '<your_consumer_key>'
consumer_secret = '<your_consumer_secret>'
access_token_key = '<your_access_token_key>'
access_token_secret = '<your_access_token_secret>'
```
