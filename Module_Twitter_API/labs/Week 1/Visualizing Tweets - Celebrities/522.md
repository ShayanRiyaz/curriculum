<!--title={Creating The Wordcloud}-->

We want to set the parameters in our wordcloud by doing the following:

```python
cloud = WordCloud(
	background_color = <your_preferred_color>,
	stopwords = stopwords,
	max_words = <your_preferred_max_words>,
	max_font_sizeint = <your_preferred_max_size>,
	random_state = <your_preferred_value>)
```

After that, we generate the wordcloud as follows:

```python
wordcloud = cloud.generate(str(text))
```
