<!--title={Creating A .csv File}-->

First, let's name our new .cvs file. We want the name to contain the user's name followed by some explanations. The variable "outfile" stores the name for us.

```python
outfile = username + "_tweets_V1.cvs"
```



Then we can make sure that we are writing to our .cvs file by typing `print("writing to " + outfile)` in the following line.
