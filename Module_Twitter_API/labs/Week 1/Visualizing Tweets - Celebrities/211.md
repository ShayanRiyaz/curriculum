<!--title={Authorization Keys}-->

Start off by define the function:

```python
def get_tweet(username):
```

We could call the `OAuthHandler()` function from by `tweepy` library by using the dot operator. The funcion takes in what you want to gain authorization to, so we can simply do

```python
auth = tweepy.OAuthHandler(consumer_key,consumer_secret)
```

After getting these authorization, we want to gain access to the access key and the access secret. Use the `set_access_token()` function as following:

```python
auth.set_access_token(access_token_key,access_token_secret)
```
