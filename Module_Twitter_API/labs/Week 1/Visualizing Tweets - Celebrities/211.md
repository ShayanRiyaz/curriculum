<!--title={Authorization Keys}-->

Define a function called `get_tweet()` which takes the parameter `username` as below:

```python
def get_tweet(username):
```

Under that function, we gain authorization to the consumer key and consumer secret by using the function `OAuthHandler()` from the `tweepy` library as below:

```python
auth = tweepy.OAuthHandler(consumer_key,consumer_secret)
```

After that, we want to gain access to the access key and the access secret. Use the `set_access_token()` function to do the following:

```python
auth.set_access_token(access_token_key,access_token_secret)
```
