The next thing we will move on to is to create our main function. This function utilizes the tweets we obtained into a .csv file in the previous function, cleanse them, and output a Wordcloud based on the highest number of repeated words.

To do that, we first define our `main()` function. In that function, we start by obtaining the tweet-filled .csv file with the `get_tweets()` function we defined earlier. 

Then, you should pick a celebrity that you want to examine the tweets of, and pass the company's Twitter handle into `get_tweets()`. 


Then, use the `read_csv()` function from the `pandas`library to read the data in the cvs file and store it in a variable called `bg`.

`read_csv()` takes in the name of a .csv file and reads it into a DataFrame. A DataFrame is a data structure with columns containing information. You can think of it like a spreadsheet.

We cleanse the data in `bg` and store them into `bg2`, then we could make `bg2` into `bg3`, a two-dimentional size-mutable tabular data structure **dataframe** by using `dataframe()` function.


Please leave the code utilizing the `re` library inside of `main()`.
