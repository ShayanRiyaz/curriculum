The next thing we will move on to is to create our main function. 

This function utilizes the tweets we obtained into a .csv file in the previous function, cleanse them, and output a Wordcloud based on the highest number of repeated words.

In this function, we start by obtaining the tweet-filled .csv file with the specific username.

Then, read the data in the cvs file and store it in a variable and cleanse the data using `re` library.

Then, use the `read_csv()` function from the `pandas`library to read the data in the cvs file and store it in a variable called `bg`.

`read_csv()` takes in the name of a .csv file and reads it into a DataFrame. A DataFrame is a data structure with columns containing information. You can think of it like a spreadsheet.

We cleanse the data in `bg` and store them into `bg2`, then we could make `bg2` into `bg3`, a two-dimentional size-mutable tabular data structure **dataframe** by using `dataframe()` function.


Please leave the code utilizing the `re` library inside of `main()`.
