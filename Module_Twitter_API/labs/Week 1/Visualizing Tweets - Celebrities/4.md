The next thing we will move on to is to create our main function. This function utilizes the tweets we obtained into a .csv file in the previous function, cleanse them, and output a Wordcloud based on the highest number of repeated words.

To do that, we first define our `main()` function. In that function, we start by obtaining the tweet-filled .csv file with the `get_tweets()` function we defined earlier. 

Then, you should pick a celebrity that you want to examine the tweets of, and pass the company's Twitter handle into `get_tweets()`. 

Then, use the `read_csv()` function from the `pandas` library. `read_csv()` takes in the name of a .csv file and reads it into a DataFrame. A DataFrame is a data structure with columns containing information. You can think of it like a spreadsheet.

Please leave the code utilizing the `re` library inside of `main()`. Also please make sure you name your object from `read_csv` "bg". Bear in mind the "cleaned" data will be in the DataFrame "bg3".
