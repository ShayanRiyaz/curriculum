### What is a Data Frame?

You may never hear of data frame before but you must have been working with an Excel chart. Now, a data frame is a 2D data structure which just looks like an Excel table. Every data is stored in rectangular grids. When creating a data frame using python pandas library, we should pay attention to the three principle components: the data, the index, and the columns. The data in the columns may have different data types.

### Why Data Frame?

By storing existing datasets, information and Excel files into a python pandas dataframe, we can easily manipulate and analyze data. It is a very flexible and powerful data structure.
