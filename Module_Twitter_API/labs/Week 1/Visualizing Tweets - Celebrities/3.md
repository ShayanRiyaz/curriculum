Now that the `get_tweet()` function can help us get access to the user's tweets, we want it to help us obtain a number of tweets from the user into a **list** and write it to a new **.csv file**. 


First, we want to declare an empty **list** and name it `tfile` to store the extracted tweets from the user. Then, we can create a **for loop** to access the items in `tweepy.Cursor()` and append tweet data into the `tfile` list.


The information that we want to append into `tfile` are `username`, `tweet.id_str`, `tweet.source`, `tweet.created_at`, `tweet.retweet_count`, `tweet.favourite_count`, and `tweet.text.encode("utf-8")`.
