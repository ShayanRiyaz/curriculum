Now that the `get_tweet()` function can help us get access to the user's tweets, we want it to help us obtain a number of tweets from the user into a **list** and write it to a new **.csv file** as well. So let's continue to elaborate on our `get_tweet()` function.



V1: To do that, we first declare an empty list and name it `tfile`. Then, create a for loop to access the items in `tweepy.Cursor()` and append tweet data into the `tfile` list. `tweepy.Cursor` is a Callable that takes in a user timeline and id. It helps us iterate through the items in the specified user's tweets.

The information that we want to append into `tfile` are `username`, `tweet.id_str`, `tweet.source`, `tweet.created_at`, `tweet.retweet_count`, `tweet.favourite_count`, and `tweet.text.encode("utf-8")`.

The information that we want to append into `tfile` are `username`, `tweet.id_str`, `tweet.source`, `tweet.created_at`, `tweet.retweet_count`, `tweet.favourite_count`, and `tweet.text.encode("utf-8")`.

Once we have all our data we need in our `tfile` list, we copy them into a new csv file by declaring a new .csv file named `outfile`. To copy the data from `tfile` into the .csv file, we will use the `open` and `writerow` functions.

Once we are done with this, we have completed our `get_tweet()` function and we can move on to define our main function.
