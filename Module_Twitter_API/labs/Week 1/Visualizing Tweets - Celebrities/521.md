<!--title={Combining Words From Tweets}-->

### Step 1: Setting Stopwords

We could set the `stopword` variable using `set()` function and STOPWORDS from the wordcloud library.

```python
stopwords = set(STOPWORDS)
```

We use stopwords so that we can filter out commonly used words in the English language like "I", "the", "in", etc. It will give us a more unique wordcloud.

### Step 2: Jointing Tweets

Next, create a variable `text` that store the joint tweets in bg3 separated with a space, using funciton join in python. To access every tweet in bg3, we will want to use a for loop.

```python
for tweet in bg3:
    text = ' '.join(tweet)
```
