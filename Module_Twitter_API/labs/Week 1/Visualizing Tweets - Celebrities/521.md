<!--title={Combining Words From Tweets}-->

Now, we want to create the Wordcloud using `STOPWORDS` and `WordCloud` from the `wordcloud` library. We start by setting the stopwords, as follows:

```python
stopwords = set(STOPWORDS)
```

Next, create a variable `text` that joins all the tweets in `bg3`, separated with a space:

```python
text = " ".join(<every_tweet_in_bg3>)
```
