### Step 1: Setting Stopwords

We could set the `stopword` variable using `set()` function and `STOPWORDS` from the `wordcloud` library.

```python
stopwords = set(STOPWORDS)
```

We use stopwords so that we can filter out commonly used words in the English language like "I", "the", "in", etc. It will give us a more unique wordcloud.
