<!--title={Setting Parameters Of Wordcloud Figure}-->

We call the function `rcParams[]` from the `matplotlib` library by using the dot operator. It takes in the parameter as argument, and we can set it to what we want.

For example, we can set `figure.figsize` to [3.5, 6.5] by

```python
mpl.rcParams['figure.figsize'] = [3.5, 6.5]
```

And similarly, we can set the other parameters `font.size`, `savefig.dpi`, and `figure.subplot.bottom` to the desired one.

The parameters `figure.figsize` and `font.size` should be pretty straight forward, you can set them to any integer value you'd like.

`savefig.dpi` also can be set as an integer value. The value you set it to will be the resolution in dots per inch.
