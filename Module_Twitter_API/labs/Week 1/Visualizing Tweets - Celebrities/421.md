<!--title={Creating A Data Frame Of Tweets}-->

After obtaining our cleansed tweets in `bg2`, we create a new variable `bg3` to form a data frame for `bg2` as follows:

```python
bg3 = pd.DataFrame(bg2, columns = ['tweet'])
```

`pd.DataFrame()` takes many parameters: data, index, columns, dtype, and copy, but we will only need to use the data and columns parameters. `data` is the information we are passing in, in our case the cleansed tweets in bg2, and `columns` is the column labels to be shown in our table.



Additionally, print out `bg3` to make sure we have the data frame output that we want.

```python
print(bg3)
```
