<!--title={Displaying WordCloud}-->

After we have created our Wordcloud, we want to display it. To do so, we use functions from the `matplotlib.pyplot` library. We start by plotting a figure:

```python
fig = matplotlib.pyplot.figure(1)
```



Then, we adjust some parameters and display our wordcloud by doing the following:

```python
matplotlib.pyplot.imshow(<your_wordcloud>)
matplotlib.pyplot.axis('off')
matplotlib.pyplot.show()
```

`matplotlib.pyplot.imshow()` displays the image, but does not store the image data of your wordcloud. We're calling it here to check to see if our wordcloud looks correct.

`matplotlib.pyplot.axis('off')` hides the axes so that we get a clean looking wordcloud.

`matplotlib.pyplot.show()` starts an event loop, looks for all currently active figure objects, and opens one or more interactive windows that display your figure or figures.



Once you have done the above, you can choose to add another line of code to save the Wordcloud you generated with the `savefig()` function as shown:

```python
fig.savefig("<your_wordcloud_file_name>",dpi=1400)
```
