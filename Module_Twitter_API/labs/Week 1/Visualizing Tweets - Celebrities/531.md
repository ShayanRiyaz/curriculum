<!--title={Displaying WordCloud}-->

After we have created our Wordcloud, we want to display it. To do so, we use functions from the `matplotlib.pyplot` library. We start by plotting a figure:

```python
fig = matplotlib.pyplot.figure(1)
```

Then, we adjust some parameters and display our wordcloud by doing the following:

```python
matplotlib.pyplot.imshow(<your_wordcloud>)
matplotlib.pyplot.axis('off')
matplotlib.pyplot.show()
```

Once you have done the above, you can choose to add another line of code to save the Wordcloud you generated with the `savefig()` function as shown:

```python
fig.savefig("<your_wordcloud_file_name>",dpi=1400)
```
