<!--title={Displaying WordCloud}-->

### Step 1: Displaying WordCloud

After we have created our Wordcloud, we want to display it. Functions from the `matplotlib.pyplot` library can help us do this. 

We start by plotting a figure:

```python
fig = matplotlib.pyplot.figure(1)
```

### Step 2: Adjusting Parameters of the Figure

Then, we can adjust some parameters such as `imshow()`, and `axis()`, and we can display our wordcloud by using `show()`.


```python
matplotlib.pyplot.imshow(<your_wordcloud>)
matplotlib.pyplot.axis('off')
matplotlib.pyplot.show()
```

`matplotlib.pyplot.imshow()` displays the image, but does not store the image data of your wordcloud. We're calling it here to check to see if our wordcloud looks correct.

`matplotlib.pyplot.axis('off')` hides the axes so that we get a clean looking wordcloud.

`matplotlib.pyplot.show()` starts an event loop, looks for all currently active figure objects, and opens one or more interactive windows that display your figure or figures.

### Step 4: Maybe You Want to Save Your WordCloud


Once you have done the above, you can choose to add another line of code to save the Wordcloud you generated with the `savefig()` function as shown:

```python
fig.savefig("<your_wordcloud_file_name>")
```

and you can include other parameters you want to set in the `savefig()`. Click [here](https://matplotlib.org/3.1.1/api/pyplot_summary.html) to see all the parameters.
