<!--title={Loading Packages}-->

## Import packages

The following packages will need to be installed in order to complete the necessary functions of the lab. By now you are already familiar with loading Python packages thanks to your previous labs.

``` python
import os
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns
import itertools
import collections

import tweepy as tw
import nltk
from nltk.corpus import stopwords
import re
import networkx

import warnings
warnings.filterwarnings("ignore")

sns.set(font_scale=1.5)
sns.set_style("whitegrid")
```

As we progress thourgh the lab you will see how all these packages play a key role in developing our program.
