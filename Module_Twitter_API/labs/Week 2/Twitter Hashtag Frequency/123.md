<!--title={Accessing the API}-->

Now that we have created our access token, we can finally access the API. this can be done in a simple line.

``` python
api = tw.API(auth, wait_on_rate_limit=True)
```
`wait_on_rate_limit=True` will wait if the rate limit has been reached. We all
have a limit amount of times to use this API (all calls are not free, so you
cannot keep using the API rapidly in a short span of time)
