# Finding Tweets

Now that we've authenticated we're ready to search for tweets. Pick a hashtag that you would like to search tweets for, like #climatechange. Put together a **list** of the text of the 100 most recent tweets pertaining to that hashtag.

Afterwards, process that list to make a **dictionary** of all of the hashtags in those 100 tweets. The dictionary should have hashtags as keys and tweet amounts as values.

*Hint:* Given a tweet taken from `tweepy`, the `entities` attribute contains all of the hashtags that pertain to a tweet. No need to process them on your own!
