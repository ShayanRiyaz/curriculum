**Step 1: Registering our client application with Twitter**

Create an `OAuthHandler` Instance from our `Tweepy` library and assign it to a variable `auth`.

The OAuthHandler Instance is a function which takes two parameters, `consumer_key` and `consumer_secret`. 

**Step 2: Storing Access Tokens for later use**

Twitter currently does not expire tokens, so it is better to store our tokens now rather than re-fetching them every time. 

Use the `set_access_token()` function as a sub-function of the variable `auth.`
