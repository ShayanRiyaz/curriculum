<!--title={Loading Packages}-->

The following packages will need to be installed in order to complete the necessary functions of the lab. By now you are already familiar with loading Python packages thanks to your previous labs.

``` python
import os # works with the operating system
import pandas as pd # storing and display data in nice data frames (tables)
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt # graphing data
import seaborn as sns # graphing data
import itertools # iterating/traversing through data
import collections # containers (storing data)

import tweepy as tw # twitter API
import nltk # natural language processing (machine learning)
from nltk.corpus import stopwords # stop words are common words that should be removed when doing machine learning
import re # regular expressions for finding patterns of phrases
import networkx # for studying graphs and networks

import warnings # for allowing use of functions to alert user of some potentially code-breaking lines you wrote

import warnings
warnings.filterwarnings("ignore")

sns.set(font_scale=1.5)
sns.set_style("whitegrid")
```

As we progress thourgh the lab you will see how all these packages play a key role in developing our program.
