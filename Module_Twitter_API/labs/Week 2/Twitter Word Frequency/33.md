<!--title={Addressing Case Issues}-->

Another challenge we will address is capitalization which becomes a challenge with data analysis for text data. If you are trying to create a list of unique words in your tweets, words with capitalization will be different from words that are all lowercase.

Here's an example:

```python
# Note how capitalization impacts unique returned values
ex_list = ["Dog", "dog", "dog", "cat", "cat", ","]

# Get unique elements in the list
set(ex_list)
{',', 'Dog', 'cat', 'dog'}
```

A set is an unordered list that cannot contain duplicates
