<!--title={re.sub method}-->

The `re.sub` method allows you to substitute a selection of characters defined using a regular expression, with something else.

In the function defined below, this line takes the text in each tweet and replaces the URL with nothing:

``` python
re.sub("([^0-9A-Za-z \t])|(\w+:\/\/\S+)", "", tweet
```

The first argument `([^0-9A-Za-z \t])|(\w+:\/\/\S+)` specifies any character or special character

The second argument is what we are replacing with.
