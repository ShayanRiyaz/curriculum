<!--title={Introduction}-->

For this lab we will utilize the skills you've gained working with APIs to visualize tweets using the **tweepy** Twitter API.

The idea is simple, given a hashtag, the top 15 words pertaining to that hashtag are displayed and plotted on a bar graph.

Twitter users use hashtags to summarize their feelings and associate their tweets with a greater idea or belief. By seeing the most common words associated with a hashtag, we can gain a general sense of what people are talking about with a certain hashtag, how people feel and gain a greater grasp of what the general sentiment is around a hashtag. It's easy to get caught in our own echo chambers on social media, and analyzing the most common words across *all* tweets for a certain hashtag helps us analyze the feelings behind a hashtag in a more objective manner. 

Here is an example of what we will be aiming to accomplish at the end of this lab:
