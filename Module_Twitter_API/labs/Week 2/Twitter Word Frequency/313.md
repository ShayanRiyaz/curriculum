<!--title={Creating a remove_url function}-->

Using the re.sub method we just looked at we can create a function that removes urls from the items of our list.

```python
def remove_url(txt):
    return " ".join(re.sub("([^0-9A-Za-z \t])|(\w+:\/\/\S+)", "", txt).split())
```

This is a simple function that accomplishes quiet a lot. We replace URLs found ina. text string with nothing.

The parameters that the function takes in is a text string which we'd like to parse and remove urls from. The function returns the same txt string with url's removed.



`join` concatenates strings returned by `re.sub("([^0-9A-Za-z \t])|(\w+:\/\/\S+)` with "", separated by a space (specified by the beginning being " ")
