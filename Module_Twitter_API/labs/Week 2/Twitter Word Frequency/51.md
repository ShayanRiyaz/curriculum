<!--title={Using the pd.DataFrame}-->

Based on the counter, you can create a `Pandas Dataframe` for analysis and plotting that includes only the top 15 most common words.

``` python
clean_tweets_no_urls = pd.DataFrame(counts_no_urls.most_common(15),
                             columns=['words', 'count'])

clean_tweets_no_urls.head()
```

This will return a Pandas DataFrame containing two columns with the words and the frequencies they appear in our items.

```
         words  count
tweet1       6      7
tweet2       1      2
```
