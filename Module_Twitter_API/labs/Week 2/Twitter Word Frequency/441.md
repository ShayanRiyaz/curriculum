This is how you can use the `pandas` library to  store the top 15 frequently occuring tweets in a dataframe:

```python
    clean_tweets_no_urls = pd.DataFrame(counts_no_urls.most_common(15),
                                        columns=['words', 'count'])
    print(clean_tweets_no_urls.head())
```

When we create a dataframe, we usually pass in the columns names we want as well.
