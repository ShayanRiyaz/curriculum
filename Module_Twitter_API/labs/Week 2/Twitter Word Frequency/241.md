This is how you can filter the tweets and removed url's in the tweets. 

```python
    all_tweets_no_urls = [remove_url(tweet) for tweet in all_tweets]
    print(all_tweets_no_urls[:5])
```

Here we are using **List Comprehension** and iterating over every element in the `all_tweets` list and passing the `remove_url()` function we wrote over each tweet.
