This is how you should extract all of the tweets **text** and then print the first few values of `all_values`.

```python
all_tweets = [tweet.text for tweet in tweets]
print(all_tweets_no_urls[:5])
```

**Note:** The above is an example of Python **List Comprehension** which essentially means we are writing an **iteration loop within a list** declaration. We use **tweets.text** to extract only the text of the tweets rather than the whole list of attributes.
