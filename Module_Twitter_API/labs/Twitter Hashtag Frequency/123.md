<!--title={Accessing the API}-->

## Accessing the API

Now that we have created our access token we can finally access the API, which can be done in a simple line.

``` python
api = tw.API(auth, wait_on_rate_limit=True)
```

`auth` is reponsible for authenticating your access to the API via your keys

`wait_on_rate_limit` will specify whether the function call will wait if you have called the API too many times (instead of quitting), since the API has a limited amount of times you can call the API
