## Creating a List of Clean Tweets

Now that we have finished removing urls from our tweets we can add them to a list for analysis. 

Again, we will use list comprehension to accomplish this task:

``` python
all_tweets_no_urls = [remove_url(tweet) for tweet in all_tweets]
all_tweets_no_urls[:5]
```

Displaying the output of our first 5 elements of the list we see a much cleaner result:

```python
['InsuranceBureau Hey Yoohoo Hey InsuranceBureau Maybe sometime before today and everyday from now on you sh',
 'Our rulers are golfing and trail running while human civilization burns down New piece by KateAronoff climate',
 'These findings lend themselves to a somewhat controversial idea that we might be able to manipulate these marine',
 'Information based on proven data about climate change and how this affects waterAvailability is so important Tha',
 'Heres what EmoryUniversity is doing to tackle climate change You can get involved by visiting']
```
