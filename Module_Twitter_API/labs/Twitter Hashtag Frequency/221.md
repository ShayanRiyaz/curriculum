## Grabbing 1000 Recent Tweets

For our analysis we need an accurate sample size for credible findings. We will grab 1,000 tweets under the climate change hashtag for our analysis.

To accomplish this we will use the Cursor method to iterate through the tweets, you may remember seeing this method from a previous lab.

``` python
tweets = tw.Cursor(api.search,
                   q=search_term,
                   lang="en",
                   since='2018-11-01').items(1000)
```

Using the Cursor method tell the iterator to search through the api, with the climate change hashtag, in english. There will be 1000 items in this iteration from tweets tweeted since Novemeber 1st 2018.
