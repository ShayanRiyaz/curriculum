Our previous function `draw()` let's use see whether we update `grid` properly, so we now need to write a function to actually perform updates to `grid`.

`move()` will not update `grid` itself. It will return the correct key to update. `main()` will handle the actual update to `grid`, so here just determine which key to return

A **tuple** of the old position is returned if the move is invalid (ignoring the move request).

A **tuple** of a new position is returned if the move is valid (granting the move request).



Since moving the cursor across neighboring points requires more lines of code, than marking points, we only need to define a function for moving and not marking.

Let's call this function `move()`, since it moves the cursor around the grid.

```python
def move():
```

We will need the `grid` for grid data, `pos` for the current position, `direction` to know which direction to move (left, right, up, or down), `numRows` for bounds checking, and `numCols` for bounds checking.

```python
def move(grid, pos, direction, numRows, numCols):
```

We will need to analyze the row and column of `pos` a lot, so we should store them into variables `row` and `col` for good practice.

```python
def move(grid, pos, direction, numRows, numCols):
    row, col = pos
```

Let's worry about valid moves first before worrying about out of bounds moves.

We can use a four **if statements** for 'l', 'r', 'u', and 'd'

```python
if (direction == 'l'):
elif (direction == 'r'):
elif (direction == 'u'):
elif (direction == 'd'):
```

Moving left subtracts 1 from the column, so return `(row, col - 1)`

Moving right adds 1 to the column, so return `(row, col + 1)`

Moving up subtracts one from the row, so return `(row - 1, col)`

Moving down adds one to the row, so return `(row + 1, col)`

```python
if (direction == 'l'):
    return (row, col - 1)
elif (direction == 'r'):
    return (row, col + 1)
elif (direction == 'u'):
    return (row - 1, col)
elif (direction == 'd'):
    return (row + 1, col)
```

We need to check for out of bounds, now.

Inside each if statement, add another if statement to do so. For the variable (either `row` or `col`), check if adding or subtracting 1 will result in a negative value or a value greater than or equal to `numCols` or `numRows`). If out of bounds, then return the original position`(row, col)`.

Remember to do this for each of the 4 if statements

```python
if (direction == 'l'):
    if (col - 1 <= 0):
        return (row, col)
    return (row, col - 1)
elif (direction == 'r'):
    if (col + 1 >= numCols):
        return (row, col)
    return (row, col + 1)
elif (direction == 'u'):
    if (row - 1 <= 0):
        return (row, col)
    return (row - 1, col)
elif (direction == 'd'):
    if (row + 1 >= numRows):
        return (row, col)
    return (row + 1, col)
```
