Now we have to take care of each different symbol to print out

- "O" for unmarked and not current position
- "^" for unmarked and current position
- "*" for marked and not current position
- "@" for marked and current position

We can use **if-elif** statements for this. Let's save invalid input checking for `main()` later. We are evaluating the values of the `grid` dictionary, which is a **list** of two booleans, so we just need one if or elif for all possible combinations (4 combinations total). 

```python
# unmarked and not current position
if (not grid[point][0] and not grid[point][1]):
# unmarked and current position
elif (not grid[point][0] and grid[point][1]):
# marked and not current position
elif (grid[point][0] and not grid[point][1]):
# marked and current position
elif (grid[point][0] and grid[point][1]):
```

We need to print out the corresponding character for each statement. Since we are controlling where our newlines are printed, let's set optional second argument of `print()` (which is end) to equal the **empty string** to remove the automatic newline.

```python
# unmarked and not current position
if (not grid[point][0] and not grid[point][1]):
    print("O", end="")
# unmarked and current position
elif (not grid[point][0] and grid[point][1]):
    print("^", end="")
# marked and not current position
elif (grid[point][0] and not grid[point][1]):
    print("*", end="")
# marked and current position
elif (grid[point][0] and grid[point][1]):
    print("@", end="")
```

Let's add some spacing at the end for a better look; then our entire function looks like this:

```python
def draw(grid, numRows, numCols):
    ''' prints out the entire grid based on the dictionary grid's values
        values are lists of two booleans, where the first denotes marked
        and the second denotes current position
        "O" for unmarked and not current position
        "^" for unmarked and current position
        "*" for marked and not current position
        "@" for marked and current position
    '''
    for row in range(0, numRows):
        print("")
        for col in range(0, numCols):
            point = (row, col)
            # unmarked and not current position
            if (not grid[point][0] and not grid[point][1]):
                print("O", end="")
            # unmarked and current position
            elif (not grid[point][0] and grid[point][1]):
                print("^", end="")
            # marked and not current position
            elif (grid[point][0] and not grid[point][1]):
                print("*", end="")
            # marked and current position
            elif (grid[point][0] and grid[point][1]):
                print("@", end="")
    print("\n") # spacing
```
