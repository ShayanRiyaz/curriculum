We are going to write a program that lets you traverse a grid and mark specific points, sort of like a painting canvas but in ASCII symbols. We will have to keep track of the current position we are on at all times (the cursor).

The user can enter

* 'l' to move the cursor one point to the left
* 'r' to move the cursor one point to the right
* 'u' to move the cursor one point up
* 'd' to move the cursor one point down
* Nothing (just press Enter) to mark/unmark the current position

When we attempt to move off the grid, we will not move the cursor anywhere and remain at the current position.

We will be storing data for each point in a dictionary called `grid`. The keys for `grid` are **tuples** for the coordinates (row, column), and the values for `grid` are **lists** of two Boolean elements. The first Boolean element of every list value is `True` if that point is marked.

The second Boolean element is `True` if that point is the current position (where the cursor is).

* "O" for unmarked and not current position
* "^" for unmarked and current position
* "*" for marked and not current position
* "@" for marked and current position

Example output of finished program:

```
>>> main()

^OOOO
OOOOO
OOOOO
OOOOO
OOOOO

Current position: (0, 0)
Type 'l', 'r', 'u', or 'd' to move and Enter to flip
Enter a command: d

OOOOO
^OOOO
OOOOO
OOOOO
OOOOO

Current position: (1, 0)
Type 'l', 'r', 'u', or 'd' to move and Enter to flip
Enter a command: r

OOOOO
O^OOO
OOOOO
OOOOO
OOOOO

Current position: (1, 1)
Type 'l', 'r', 'u', or 'd' to move and Enter to flip

Enter a command: 

OOOOO
O@OOO
OOOOO
OOOOO
OOOOO

Current position: (1, 1)
Type 'l', 'r', 'u', or 'd' to move and Enter to flip
Enter a command: d

OOOOO
O*OOO
O^OOO
OOOOO
OOOOO

Current position: (2, 1)
Type 'l', 'r', 'u', or 'd' to move and Enter to flip
Enter a command: 

OOOOO
O*OOO
O@OOO
OOOOO
OOOOO

Current position: (2, 1)
Type 'l', 'r', 'u', or 'd' to move and Enter to flip
Enter a command: d

OOOOO
O*OOO
O*OOO
O^OOO
OOOOO


```

The first function we need to write is one to print out the entire grid, so we can see whether we are modifying it correctly.

We will need the number of rows and columns to check for out of bounds.

To define a function, we first type `def`, a space, the name of the function, then the arguments to the function within parenthesis. Then we add a colon at the end of all that.

Let's call our function `draw`, since we are drawing the grid.

We are taking in the entire grid data `grid`, the number of rows `numRows`, and the number of columns `numCols`.

```python
def draw(grid, numRows, numCols):
```

We need to iterate through all the elements of `grid` for up to `numRows`. Within each row, we need to iterate through all elements of that row for up to `numCol`. We can use a **nested for loop** for this.

```python
def draw(grid, numRows, numCols):
    for row in range(0, numRows):
        for col in range(0, numCols):
```

We would like to control where newlines are printed out, so we would like to print out a newline after each row.

```python
def draw(grid, numRows, numCols):
    for row in range(0, numRows):
        print("")
        for col in range(0, numCols):
```

With this nested loop setup, each point is a **tuple** of `row` and `col`. Let's store that in a variable since we will use this a lot. This variable will hold the keys to access the values of`grid`.

```python
def draw(grid, numRows, numCols):
    for row in range(0, numRows):
        print("")
        for col in range(0, numCols):
            point = (row, col)
```

We will next handle printing out each character.
