Now that we have all the necessary functions, we need to utilize them in our `main()` function.

We will handle initializing `grid` appropriately as well as handling looping the `draw()` and `move()` functions here as well as invalid input.

First, we have to specify our grid size by storing the number of rows and columns into variables.

```python
numRows = numCols = 5
```

Next, we have to initialize the values of `grid` with a **list** of two booleans with the value `False`, since all points start off unmarked and as not the current position (except `(0, 0)`, which we will modify immediately after this by setting the key `(0, 0)` to `[False, True]`).

```python
# initialize grid, values are a list of [isCurrentPosition, marked]
grid = {(row, col) : [False, False] for row in range(0, numRows) for col in range(0, numCols)}
pos = (0, 0)

# mark 0,0 as current position
grid[pos][1] = True
```

Now we need a **while loop** to continuously call `draw()`, take in user input, then handle that input appropriately.

```python
while (True):
```

First, call `draw()` by passing in `grid`, `numRows`, and `numCols`

```python
while (True):
    draw(grid, numRows, numCols)
```

We can print out the current position each iteration as well as instructions on what to type to make the output more user-friendly. We will use an **f string** for printing `pos`, since it is easier to read than by using **string concatenation**. We also need to read in input from the user.

```python
while (True):
    draw(grid, numRows, numCols)
    print(f"Current position: {pos}")
    print("Type 'l', 'r', 'u', or 'd' to move and Enter to flip")
    command = input("Enter a command: ")
```

Now we have the necessary input from the user; we have to evaluate it with **if statements** now, what they typed in.

If they only pressed the "Enter" key, then they entered in the empty string. For this, we have to toggle the current position's "marked" condition (mark it if it was unmarked or unmark it if it was marked) or in other words, set the first Boolean in the value in `grid` to the opposite value, since the first Boolean represents whether a point was marked or not.

```python
while (True):
    draw(grid, numRows, numCols)
    print(f"Current position: {pos}")
    print("Type 'l', 'r', 'u', or 'd' to move and Enter to flip")
    command = input("Enter a command: ")
    # invert whether position was "Marked"
    if (command == ""):
        grid[pos][0] = not grid[pos][0]
```

If the user typed 'l', 'r', 'u', or 'd', then this indicates the user wants to move the cursor, so we should call `move()`. We can check for this in one **if statement** using the boolean **or** operator.

```python
# update pos with respect to command
elif (command == 'l' or command == 'r' or command == 'u' or command == 'd'):
```

Let's work under this **elif** statement now.

Remember we saved updating `grid` from calling `move()` in the last task. Now, we will do this.

The first thing to do in this **elif** is to set the current position `pos` to not be the current position (since we are attempting to move the current position to another one).

We do this by modifying `grid`. We index `grid` at `pos` and change the second boolean of the list value to `False`.

```python
grid[pos][1] = False
```

Now we need to determine which position/coordinate to set as our new current position. We wrote the function `move()` exactly to determine this for us. Set `pos` equal to whatever is returned from a call to `move()`.

```python
grid[pos][1] = False
pos = move(grid, pos, command, numRows, numCols)
```

Then, set the returned `pos` to our current position by setting the second boolean to `True`

```python
grid[pos][1] = False
pos = move(grid, pos, command, numRows, numCols)
grid[pos][1] = True
```

We are done with this **elif** statement.

Lastly, we check for invalid input using an **else** and print out "Invalid command"

```python
else:
    print("Invalid command")
```

Here is the entire `main()`:

```python
def main():
    numRows = numCols = 5

    # initialize grid, values are a list of [isCurrentPosition, marked]
    grid = {(row, col) : [False, False] for row in range(0, numRows) for col in range(0, numCols)}
    pos = (0, 0)

    # mark 0,0 as current position
    grid[pos][1] = True
    
    while (True):
        draw(grid, numRows, numCols)
        print(f"Current position: {pos}")
        print("Type 'l', 'r', 'u', or 'd' to move and Enter to flip")
        command = input("Enter a command: ")

        # invert whether position was "Marked"
        if (command == ""):
            grid[pos][0] = not grid[pos][0]
        # update pos with respect to command
        elif (command == 'l' or command == 'r' or command == 'u' or command == 'd'):
            grid[pos][1] = False
            pos = move(grid, pos, command, numRows, numCols)
            grid[pos][1] = True
        # all other input invalid
        else:
            print("Invalid command")
```
