# Extracting the rate, begin, and end columns

The **csv reader** has elements that are each **lists**, where each list is a row of the data file. If we use a **for loop**, then we can extract the row list's elements, which are the columns of that specific row. Each element of the lists we just extracted are each column of that row.
