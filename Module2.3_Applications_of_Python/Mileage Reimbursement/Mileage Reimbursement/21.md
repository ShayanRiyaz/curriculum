We need to follow the three steps in the parsing a file concept:

1. Open the file
2. Extract contents
3. Close the file (unless you are using `with` `as`)

With **csv parsing**, we need to create a **csv reader** and use the **next** function to obtain the fields. Then we need to obtain each row using a loop.
