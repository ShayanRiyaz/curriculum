Write a function, `repack_boxes`, which takes any number of boxes as parameters, gathers up all the items they contain, and redistributes them as evenly as possible over all the boxes. You do not need to worry about the order of the items. 

You can define your function like so:

```python
def repack_boxes(*boxes):
```

Now if we have

```python
repack_boxes(box1,box2,box3)
```

the function has three arguments and will put all box1, box2, box3 in argument list,`*boxes` . *args is used to send a **non-keyworded** variable length argument list to the function. 

After you are done: We will need to test our function to see if it is working properly. Test your code with a `BitBox` with 20 items, a `BitBox` with 9 items ,and a `BitKit` with 5 items. Append the required amount of items to each box and then run the `repack_boxes` function. 

To check the amount of items in each box, simply use the `print` command. If you end up with two boxes with 11 items each, and one box with 12 items, then **Congratulations**, you have successfully completed the lab!
