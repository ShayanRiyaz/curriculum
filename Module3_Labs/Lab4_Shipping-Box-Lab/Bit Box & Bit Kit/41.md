To append an amount of items to each box, we can simply use a for loop and the .append command. 
```python
box1 = BitBox()
items = []
for i in range(20):
    item=Item(str(i), i)
    items.append(item)
    box1.add(items)
```

To redistribute all the item, one way we can go about it, is to empty all the boxes, then putting the loose items back to the boxes again. 

Think about how to empty the boxes and get all the items, and how to redistribute the items evenly.
