Now, let's implement a functionality where customers should be able to return bikes! 

In this part of the lab, we are writing a `returnBike` functions in class `BikeRental`.

```python
def returnBike(self, request):

		# extract the tuple and initiate bill
        rentalTime, rentalBasis, numOfBikes = request
        bill = 0
        #        """
        #        1. Accept a rented bike from a customer
        #        2. Replenishes the inventory
        #        3. Return a bill
        #        """
```

In this function we will return the calculated bill. You can begin writing the function first by evaluating whether or not this request is valid. If the request is invalid then we ask : 

> Are you sure you rented a bike with us?

If they qualify family promotion, then we say:

>You are eligible for Family rental promotion of 30% discount

`request` is the returned value of the Customer's `returnBike` function. If you examine closely, `request` is a tuple, consisting of the customer's `rentalTime`, `rentalBasis`, `numOfBikes` . `rentalBasis` is the variable that determine what kind of basis that the customer has rented the bike on. 

Following is a table of the different types of rental basis and the different rate that is associated with it:

| `rentalBasis` | type   | rate         |
| ------------- | ------ | ------------ |
| 1             | hourly | $5 per hour  |
| 2             | daily  | $20 per day  |
| 3             | weekly | $60 per week |

Make sure to give them a **discount** of 30% of the total price if they satisfy the family deal requirement (when the customer rent between 3 to 5 bikes)!
