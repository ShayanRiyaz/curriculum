When n is greater than the stock, we shall print 

> Sorry! We have currently x bikes available to rent.

and return `None`.

```python
elif n > self.stock:
    print("Sorry! We have currently {} bikes available to rent.".format(self.stock)) 
    return None
```

When n is valid, we first extract our current time using date time object. Calling `datetime.datetime.now()`  will return our current time.

In order to use datetime, we have to import it at the top of the file.

```python
import datetime
```
