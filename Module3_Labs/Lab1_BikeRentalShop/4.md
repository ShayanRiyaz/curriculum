After finished writing `BikeRental` class let's finished writing our `Customer` class.

Write a `requestBike ` function that asks for the number of bikes that the user wants to rent.

Ask the user:

>  How many bikes would you like to rent?

Get the input from user, check whether or not the answer that user gives is valid.

Note that there are two possible errors:

> "That's not a positive integer!"

> " Number of bikes should be greater than zero!"

If the answer is valid, then updates `bikes` field in class, and return the number of bikes the user wants.
