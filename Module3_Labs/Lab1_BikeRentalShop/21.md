To write `rentBike`, let's review all the cases that we should consider:

- when n is a non positive number
- when n is greater than the stock
- when n is valid

We should also consider under what situation, will the different basis make a change in our `rentBike` function

When n is a non positive number, we shall print 

> Number of bikes should be positive!

and return `None`.

When n is greater than the stock, we shall print 

> Sorry! We have currently x bikes available to rent.

and return `None`.

When n is valid, we first extract our current time using date time object. Calling `datetime.datetime.now()`  will return our current time.

In order to use datetime, we have to import it at the top of the file.

```python
import datetime
```

Up until this point, basis does not play a role in our function, but the following messages will different from basis to basis. Think about how to reflect these changes:

>You have rented a x bike(s) on .... basis today at y hours.
>You will be charged $... for each ... per bike.
>We hope that you enjoy our service.

Then, we modify the number of our available stock, and return our current datetime object.

FYI. If you are worried about the type of deal not being recorded in the rent shop system. Don't worry about it! They will be dealt with using the class `Customer`'s variables !
