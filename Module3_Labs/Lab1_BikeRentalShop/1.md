In this lab, you will be using **Object Oriented Programming** to write a bike rental system that allows the customers to rent and return bikes on hourly, daily, or weekly basis!  

### Customers can

- See available bikes on the shop.
- Rent bikes on an hourly basis: $5 per hour.
- Rent bikes on a daily basis: $20 per day.
- Rent bikes on a weekly basis: $60 per week.
- Family Rental, a promotion that can include from 3 to 5 Rentals (of any type) with a discount of 30% of the total price.

### The bike rental shop can

- issue a bill when customer decides to return the bike.
- display available inventory
- take requests on hourly, daily and weekly basis by cross verifying stock

We will be creating two **classes** in this project,  **Bike Rental** and **Customer**.

Create your `bikeRental.py`.

### Class: Bike Rental

Given  `__init__` function for our Bike Rental class in the starter code.

```python
class BikeRental:
    def __init__(self, stock=0):
        """
        Our constructor class that instantiates bike rental shop.
        """
        self.stock = stock
```
You will be taking in a parameter `stock`, that will determine how many bikes you have in the shop you instantiated. For example, 

```python 
davis_rental = BikeRental(100) 
bike_barn = BikeRental(80) 
```

From now on `davis_rental` will have 100 bikes available to be rent out, whereas `bike_barn` will have 80 bikes available to be rent.

### Class: Customer

```python
class Customer:
    def __init__(self):
        """
        Our constructor method which instantiates various customer objects.
        """    
        self.bikes = 0
        self.rentalBasis = 0
        self.rentalTime = 0
        self.bill = 0
	def returnBike(self):
        """
        Allows customers to return their bikes to the rental shop.
        """
        if self.rentalBasis and self.rentalTime and self.bikes:
            return self.rentalTime, self.rentalBasis, self.bikes  
        else:
            return 0,0,0
```

You are given a `Customer` class!  The constructor will instantiate your customer variables: `bikes` , `rentalBasis`, `rentalTime`, and `bill` in your constructor with zero. The `returnBike` function allows customers to return their bikes to the rental shop, returning 3 variables.

Now that we have gotten our classes initiated, let's get our rental shop up and running! 

Let's first start off by writing the function `displaystock` that **returns** the number of stocks a shop has and print out the following message:

```python
>>> We have currently x bikes available to rent.
```

x being the number of stock a bike has. 

```python
def displaystock(self):
    """
    TODO: Displays and returns the number of bikes currently available for rent in the shop.
    """    
```
