<!--title={Rent Bikes: when n is a non positive number}-->

<!--badges={Python:18}-->

To write `rentBike`, let's review all the cases that we should consider:

- when n is a non positive number
- when n is greater than the stock
- when n is valid

When n is a non positive number, we shall print 

> Number of bikes should be positive!

and return `None`

```python
if n <= 0:
    print("Number of bikes should be positive!")
            return None
```
