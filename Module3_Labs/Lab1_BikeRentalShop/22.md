<!--title={Rent Bike on different Basis}-->

After you are done with `rentBike`, complete `rentBikeOnHourlyBasis`, `rentBikeOnDailyBasis`, `rentBikeOnWeeklyBasis`. Keep in mind that since the three functions are very similar, all the works should be done in `rentBike` to avoid repetitiveness. In our `rentBikeOnHourlyBasis`, just call the `rentBike` function. 

So each `rentBikeOn...Basis` only needs to call `rentBike` in their function, and do the deeds. 

```python
def rentBikeOnXBasis(self, n):
        """
        Rents a bike on X basis to a customer.
        """
        ... = self.rentBike(...)
```

Remember that our rentBikeOn...Basis still has to return the time that the customer rent the bike.
