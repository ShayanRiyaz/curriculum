Use `input()` to ask for user's input.

```python
 def requestBike(self):
    bikes = input("How many bikes would you like to rent?")
```
After getting input, we have to check for errors. 

Remember that there are two possible errors:

> "That's not a positive integer!"

> " Number of bikes should be greater than zero!"

Note that the user input is still a `string`, and we should convert it to `int`.

For the first error, we can try to convert the `string` to `int`, if it fails, it must not be a valid input.

```python
try:
	bikes = int(bikes)
except ValueError:
	print("That's not a positive integer!")
	return -1
```

If it succeeds, then we should check whether or not the number of bikes is greater than zero. if it is greater than 1, then the user input is valid, and we can store the number in our class variable, `bikes`.

```python
if bikes < 1:
    print("Number of bikes should be greater than zero!")
    return -1
else:
    self.bikes = bikes
return self.bikes
```
