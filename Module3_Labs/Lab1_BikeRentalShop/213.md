Up until this point, basis does not play a role in our function, but the following messages will different from basis to basis. We print out the following messages:

> You have rented n bike(s) on X basis today at y hours.
> You will be charged $cost for each ... per bike.
> We hope that you enjoy our service.

We realize we need the following attributes:

`n`: number of bikes rented

`price`: price per bike for each time unit

`basis`: hourly/daily/weekly

`basis_unit`: hour/day/week

So we add those to our parameters for `rentBike`. (There are many other ways of doing it.)

```   python  
def rentBike(self, n, basis, price, basis_unit): 
```

So the code we have written so far have just been edge cases with regards to `n`, so the code in the previous hints can start the body of our `rentBike` function.

We continue our `rentBike` function by modifying the number of our available stock, and return our current datetime object:

```python
else:                     
    now = datetime.datetime.now()                      
    print("You have rented {} bike(s) on {} today at {} hours.".format(n, basis, now.hour))
    print("You will be charged ${} for each {} per bike.".format(price, basis_unit))
    print("We hope that you enjoy our service.")
    self.stock -= n
    return now      
```
