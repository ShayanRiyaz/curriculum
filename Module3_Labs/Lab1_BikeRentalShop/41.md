Use `input()` to ask for user's input.

After getting input, we have to check for errors. 

Remember that there are two possible errors:

> "That's not a positive integer!"

> " Number of bikes should be greater than zero!"

Note that the user input is still a `string`, and we should convert it to `int`.

For the first error, we can try to convert the `string` to `int`, if it fails, it must not be a valid input.

If it succeeds, then we should check whether or not the number of bikes is greater than zero.
