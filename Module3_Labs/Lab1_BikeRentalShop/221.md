Call your `rentBike` function with the parameters you have set for it. 

There are many ways for doing it. Feel free to have different parameters as long as functionality is the same. The following is my implementation:

``` python
def rentBikeOnHourlyBasis(self, n):
		"""
        Rents a bike on hourly basis to a customer.
        """
        now = self.rentBike(n, "hourly", 5, "hour")
        return now
     
def rentBikeOnDailyBasis(self, n):
        """
        Rents a bike on daily basis to a customer.
        """
        now = self.rentBike(n, "daily", 20, "day")
        return now
        
def rentBikeOnWeeklyBasis(self, n):
        """
        Rents a bike on weekly basis to a customer.
        """
        now = self.rentBike(n, "weekly", 60, "week")
        return now
```
