<!--title={Return Bike: Validity of the Request}-->

<!--badges={Python:30}-->

In previous card, we come to the conclusion that we can check the validity of the request by checking whether or not the request tuple is populated with actual values other than zero. 

Therefore, we can write:

```python
if rentalTime and rentalBasis and numOfBikes:
		#TODO: calculate the bill and return bill
else:
        print("Are you sure you rented a bike with us?")
        return None
```
