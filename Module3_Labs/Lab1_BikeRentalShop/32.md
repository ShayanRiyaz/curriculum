The last step is to calculate and return the bill!

In this step, we should get our current time - the rental time to get the time that has elapsed since rental. Then use this time to calculate the bill. We should also consider the different deals and how that would change the expenses of the rental, as well as considering the family deal discount. For different deals, we can use different variables of the datetime object to calculate the bill.  `timedelta.seconds()` and `timedelta.days()` may be useful.

Something to note is that when we take in a `rentalBasis` that is not a valid basis number, in other words, not 1 or 2 or 3. The bill will return 0 in this case, as demonstrated in the test cases.

Also, don't forget to replenish the shop's stocks!
