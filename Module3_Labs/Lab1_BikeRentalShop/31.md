You can begin writing the function first by evaluating whether or not the request is valid.  If the request is invalid then we ask : 

> Are you sure you rented a bike with us?

 Then, we return `None`.

Note that in the test scenario:

```python
def test_returnBike_for_valid_credentials(self):    
        # create a shop and a various customers
        shop = BikeRental(50)
        customer1 = Customer()      
        # create valid rentalBasis for each customer
        customer1.rentalBasis = 1 # hourly
        # create valid bikes for each customer
        customer1.bikes = 1
        # create past valid rental times for each customer
        customer1.rentalTime = datetime.now() + timedelta(hours=-4)
        # make all customers return their bikes
        request1 = customer1.returnBike()
        # check if all of them get correct bill
        self.assertEqual(shop.returnBike(request1), 20)
```

We process the customer's request after the program set customer's `rentalBasis`, `rentalTime`, and `bikes`.

An example of an invalid request to look out for when the customer has not rented a bike, and tries to return one. Like the following test case, we can deduce that all the customer's variables are 0 (default). 

```python
customer = Customer()

# let the customer not rent a bike a try to return one.
request = customer.returnBike()
self.assertIsNone(shop.returnBike(request))
```

Therefore, we can check the validity of the request through checking if all the tuples have real values!
