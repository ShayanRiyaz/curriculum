At the end of the class,  write a method to print the information of the zoo. It should include the following: 

- The name of the zoo 
- Capacity of the zoo
- List of Animals in the zoo

For printing the animal's info, you can iterate through a list of animals and use the animal's `print_animal_info` function.
