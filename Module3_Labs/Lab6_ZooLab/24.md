Now write a method to add an animal to the zoo. Here you should also consider the capacity of the zoo. You should be able to add an animal only if there is space in the zoo. To add an animal into the zoo, you will need to prompt the following information from the user:

 - Name
 - Gender (assume input is M/F)
 - Age 
 - Species


You can get all this information using the `input()` method. After you have access to all this information, make an `Animal` object. Append your new `Animal` to the zoo's `list_of_animals` and increment the `zoo_count`.
