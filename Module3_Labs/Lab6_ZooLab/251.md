```python
# Removes an animal from the zoo if it exists
def remove_animal_from_zoo(self):
```

```python
# Removes an animal from the zoo if it exists
def remove_animal_from_zoo(self):
```



Here is the code for removing an animal from the zoo. It first asks the user to enter the name of the animal. 

```python
    print("Input the name of the desired animal.")
    animal_to_remove = input()
```



Then you iterate through the list to find that certain animal. Once you have found that animal, you remove it from the list.

```python
    for animal in self.list_of_animals:
        if animal_to_remove == animal.animal_name:
            self.list_of_animals.remove(animal)
```

Don't forget to decrement the zoo's count:

```python
    self.zoo_count -= 1
```
