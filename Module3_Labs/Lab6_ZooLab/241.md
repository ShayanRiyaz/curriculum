```python
def add_animal_to_zoo(self):
```

```python
def add_animal_to_zoo(self):
```

We first check if the zoo has enough space to accomodate another animal:

```python
    if self.zoo_count < self.zoo_capacity:
```

Then we prompt the user to input the new animal's species, name and age:

```python
        print("Enter the species: ")
        new_animal_species = input()
        print("Enter the name: ")
        new_animal_name = input()
        print("Enter the age:")
        new_animal_age = input()
```

For the animal's gender, we have to specify a gender of M/F, and then assign a gender based on the user input:

```python
        print("Enter the gender: (M/F) ")
        new_animal_gender = input()
        if new_animal_gender.lower() == "m":
            gender = "male"
        else:
            gender = "female"
```

To make a new `Animal` with our data, we can call its constructor with the corresponding parameters:

```python
        new_animal = Animal(new_animal_name, new_animal_species, gender, new_animal_age)
```

Then the `new_animal` is appended to the zoo's list of animals, and the zoo count is incremented by 1.

```python
        self.list_of_animals.append(new_animal)
        self.zoo_count += 1
```

Don't forget to account for when there isn't enough capacity!

```python
    else:
        print("Cannot add more animals to the zoo.")
```
