<!--title={Constructor for Animal class}-->
<!--badges={Python:11}-->

Write a constructor for your class.  In Python the `__init__()` method is used to call a constructor. Whenever an object is created, `__init__()` is called. For the `Animal` class you will define the name of the animal, their species, gender and their age inside the constructor. Don't forget to use the keyword `self`!
