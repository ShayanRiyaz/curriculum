Here is the code for constructor of the zoo class. We have given our zoo a capacity of 10, a count of 0 and a name. We have declared an empty array to store the list of animals. 


```python
def __init__(self):
    self.zoo_name = "The Zoo"
    self.zoo_capacity = 10
    self.zoo_count = 0
    self.list_of_animals = []
```
