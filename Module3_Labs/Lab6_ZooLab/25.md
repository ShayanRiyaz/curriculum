For this method, you can assume that the animal always exists.

Prompt the user for the name of the animal he/she wants to remove and then iterate through the list of animals to look for that name. Find the animal in the list of animals, then go ahead and remove the animal from the list. Don't forget to decrement your `zoo_count`.
