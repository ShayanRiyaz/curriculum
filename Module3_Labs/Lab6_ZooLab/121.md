<!--title={Code for Setters}-->
<!--badges={Python:22}-->

The setters are defined as follows: the new name/age is called in as a parameter and then the class attribute is set. 

```python
# Setters
def change_animal_name(self, new_animal_name):
    self.animal_name = new_animal_name    
```
And for the age:

```python
def change_animal_age(self, new_animal_age):
    self.animal_age = new_animal_age
```
