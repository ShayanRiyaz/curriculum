In this part, let's write our `Zoo` class. This class will contain all the information about the zoo.

In your `Zoo` constructor, initialize the zoo's name to "The Zoo", the zoo's capacity to 10, the zoo's current count to zero, and the list of animals to an empty list. 

Then you will implement the following class methods as a part of the `Zoo` class:

- `change_zoo_name`: change the name of the zoo 
- `change_zoo_capacity`: change the capacity of the zoo 
- `add_animal_to_zoo`: add an animal to the zoo 
  - Appends animal to the zoo's list of animals
- `remove_animal_from_zoo`: remove an animal from the zoo 
  - You can assume that the animal being removed always exists
- `print_zoo_info`: print all the info of the zoo 

```
