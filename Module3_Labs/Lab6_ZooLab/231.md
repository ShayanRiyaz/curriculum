```python
# Changes the capacity of the zoo
def change_zoo_capacity(self):
```

```python
# Changes the capacity of the zoo
def change_zoo_capacity(self):
```

We first start off by prompting the new capacity and then casting that input to an integer:

```python
    print("Enter the new capacity: ")
    new_capacity = int(input())
```

Our zoo cannot have negative capacity, so we handle it like so:

```python
    if new_capacity < 0:
        print("Capacity cannot be less than zero.")  
```

Our zoo also cannot have less capacity than the current number of animals currently in the zoo:

```python
    elif new_capacity < self.zoo_count:
        print("Your capacity cannot be less than the current number of animals!")
```

If both those cases don't apply, then our capacity is valid.

```python
    else:
        self.zoo_capacity = new_capacity
```
