Setters are used to set variables to different values. For this example, we will have a setter for just the animal's name and age. A setter's header will look like: `change_animal_name(self, new_animal_name)`. The function needs to take in a new value. 

Getters return the value of the needed variable. A getter's header looks like: `get_animal_age(self)`.
