We can first print out the zoo's name and capacity:

```python
def print_zoo_info(self):

    print("")
    print("Zoo Information")
    print("Name: ", self.zoo_name)
    print("Capacity", self.zoo_capacity)
    print("List of Animals: ")
```

For printing out the lsit of animals, you have to iterate through the `list_of_animals` and print each animal's information using the `print_animal_info()` function.

```python
    for animal in self.list_of_animals:
        print("")
        animal.print_animal_info()
```
