We'll be writing a command-line program in Python that simulates a simple zoo, using object-oriented programming. For this lab, you can assume **all input has a valid type**. In other words, if the program asks for a name, then only a string will be inputted. If the program asks for an age, only a number will be inputted, etc. 

In this lab you'll implement the following features:

1. Getting the zoo's information 
2. Adding an animal to the zoo
3. Removing an animal from the zoo
4. Changing the capacity and name of the zoo

Let's start by creating an `Animal` class. 

Your `Animal` constructor will take name, species, gender and age parameters, and initialize each of those attributes for the `Animal`. 

Additionally we will have setters for the animal's name and age, as well as getters for the animal's name, age, species and gender.

Additionally, implement a `print_animal_info` class function that should print an animal's information in the following manner:

```python
Name: West African Lion
Species: Panthera leo senegalensis
Gender: Male
Age: 9
```
