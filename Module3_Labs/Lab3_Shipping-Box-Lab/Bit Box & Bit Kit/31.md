Let's consider how to build  `class BitBox` here.

First , let's define `BitBox` as an implementation of our abstract class `Box`

Then, initiate a variable in class,` _items`, that stores all items in the box as a list, in our `__init__` function. 

Now, write an `add` function that takes in an array of items, and add them to our item list. Write an `empty` function that return all of our items in a list, and empty our item list. Write a  `count` function, that counts the number of items which are currently in the box.   

```python
import abcplus
class BitBox(Box):
	def __init__(self):
		#initialize empty list
	def add(self,items):
		#append list of items into the box's list
	def empty(self):
		#find a way to empty the contents of your box once you're done with it
	def count(self):
		#find a way to return to the size of the list to get the number of items in the box
```
