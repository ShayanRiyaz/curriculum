To redistribute all the item, one way we can go about it, is to empty all the boxes, then putting the loose items back to the boxes again. 

Think about how to empty the boxes and get all the items, and how to redistribute the items evenly.

```python
def repack_boxes():
	#run a for loop for all the boxes we have, empty them out one by one, and add the items that we take out of the boxes into a list
	while items:
		#While the list items is not empty,  run a for loop to add one item at a time into each box
		#When the items are emptied, but the for loop is still running, implement an IndexError on the part of the while loop that removes the number of boxes per index
		#Catch that error and break out of the loop
```
