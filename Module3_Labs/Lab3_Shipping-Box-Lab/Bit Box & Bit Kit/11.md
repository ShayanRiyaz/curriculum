Remember that abstract class cannot be instantiated. Therefore we only need to write skeleton methods that subclass methods can override later. 

```python
import abcplus
class Box:
	def add(self, items):
        #add code that doesn't call the function
    def empty(self):
        #add code that doesn't call the function
    def count(self):
        #add code that doesn't call the function
 ```
