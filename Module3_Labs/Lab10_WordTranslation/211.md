First, we have to obtain valid user input. We will keep asking the user for valid input and repeat if their input is invalid forever using a **while (True) loop**.

```python
# obtain user input
while (True):
    print("Please enter 26 characters for your new alphabet")
    print("The first character replaces 'a', and the last character replaces 'z'")
    encoding = input()
```

Note this needs to be an **infinite loop,** and we break out of it when valid input (a 26 character string) is entered.

`while` statement will run until a defined condition is no longer met. If the condition is initially false, the loop body will not be executed at all. If the condition is initially true, the loop body will run forever. In this case, we set the condition to be `True` and `True ` always evaluates boolean "true". Thus `while (True)` is an infinite loop.

```python
# obtain user input
while (True):
    print("Please enter 26 characters for your new alphabet")
    print("The first character replaces 'a', and the last character replaces 'z'")
    encoding = input()
    if (len(encoding) == 26):
        break
    print("Not 26 characters")
```

Next, we need to use a **dictionary** to hold our new encoding, as well as the English alphabet as a string to hold the original English encoding.

```python
# declare necessary variables
newAlphabet = {}
engAlphabet = "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz"
```

**Note**: Instead of a dictionary, we could use a string, but then we would have to change our translation function to accommodate this.

We could declare `newAlphabet` with 26 blank variables, but this isn't necessary. We loop through each character in `charEncoding` and pair them up with the letters in the English Alphabet. Then, we return the dictionary.

```python
# create the new alphabet
i = 0
for newChar in charEncoding:
    engChar = engAlphabet[i]
    newAlphabet[engChar] = newChar
    i += 1
```

Since we know there are always going to be 26 characters, we can also use `for i in range(0, 26):` to achieve the same goal.

```python
for i in range (0, 26) :
  engChar = engAlphabet[i]
  newAlphabet[engChar] = charEncoding[i] 
```

Finally, return the result `newAlphabet`

```python
return newAlphabet
```
