Another very useful function when working with BSTs is the ability to add nodes to the tree.

#### BST Insert:

When adding a new node to a BST, we must make sure to find the correct place to insert that node. Let's look at the code for `BSTInsert`:

```Python
def BSTInsert(curNode, newNode):
    if curNode is None:
        curNode = newNode
    else:
        if curNode.key < newNode.val:
            if curNode.right is None:
                curNode.right = newNode
            else:
                BSTInsert(curNode.right, newNode)
        else:
            if curNode.left is None:
                curNode.left = newNode
            else:
                BSTInsert(curNode.left, newNode)
```

`BSTInsert` traverses through the BST in a similar way to `BSTSearch`. However, once it finds that the specific child is null in the place the new node belongs, it places that node there. Try working and experimenting with the code on your own machine.

##### Time Complexity:

Similarly to `BSTSearch`, the worst-case scenario runtime for `BSTInsert` is also **O(n)**. The worst-case would occur when you have to go through every node in the tree to find the proper place to insert the node.
