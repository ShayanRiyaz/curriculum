<!--title={Leetcode Question: Add Two Numbers}-->

One of the most famous questions regarding linked lists is the "Add Two Numbers" problem. In this problem, you are given two **non-empty** linked lists representing two non-negative integers. The digits are stored in **reverse order** and each of their nodes contain a single digit. Add the two numbers and return it as a linked list.

You may assume the two numbers do not contain any leading zero, except the number 0 itself.
