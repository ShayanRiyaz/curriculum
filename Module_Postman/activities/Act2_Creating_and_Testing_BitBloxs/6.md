# API Authentication

One last thing we need to do is authenticate our API with an API key.

Go to the `Authorization` tab and select the authorization `type` as `API Key`. Then, set the value for `Key`, `Value`, `Add to` as the following. Again, we are using the environment variable that we set up earlier for our purpose.

If you fail to complete this step, any requests that you attempt to send out will return this error message:

```json
{
    "message": "You are not authenticated, you need an API Key to use this route"
}
```

But once we use API key to access the API, it should get rid of that issue.
