# API Authentication

We have one last step to complete setup before we can start sending out requests. We still need an API key to access the API. 

Go to the `Authorization` tab and select the authorization `type` as `API Key`. Then, set the value for `Key`, `Value`, `Add to` as the following. Again, we are using the environment variable that we set up earlier for our purpose.

If you attempt to send out a request without authenticating, you will receive an error message:

```json
{
    "message": "You are not authenticated, you need an API Key to use this route"
}
```



Now that our request has all the information that we need! We should be able to send any request of our choice!
