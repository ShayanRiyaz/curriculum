For this activity, we will be using five different HTTP requests to NASA's API to construct a simple website that does the following things:

<ol>
  <li>Get the Picture of the Day from NASA</li>
  <li>Get Data pertaining to objects nearing earth</li>
  <li>Get MARS Rover Curiosity pictures</li>
  <li>Get MARS Rover Spirit pictures</li>
 	<li>Get MARS Rover Opportunity pictures</li>
</ol>

The documentation for NASA's API that was generated from a Postman collection can be found at [Postman](https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/35240/SVmtxerV?version=latest). Open the link, and then click **Run in Postman** on the top right of your screen to open NASA's API collection in Postman.

 The necessary API key can be obtained from [NASA](https://api.nasa.gov/). You simply have to go to the link and click the **Get Started** button, then fill out your information and NASA will provide you with the key.

 These API endpoints give you access to valuable information and resources that will make your website more dynamic and interesting. Currently, we do not know how to use these API requests; therefore, let's go through the Postman documentation to learn how to implement them into a website.
