What is the complexity of a doubly linked list?

For accessing and searching for elements, the average time complexity is O(n). Worst case is the same, so no matter what Big O will be O(n).

For insertion and deletion, average time complexity is O(1). Again, in the worst case it's still O(1), so it'll always be constant. 

Worst case space complexity is O(n) for all doubly linked lists.
