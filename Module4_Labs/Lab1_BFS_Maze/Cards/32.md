Now that we have a list of neighboring spaces, we have to check if each neighboring space has been visited or not. We must do this because if a neighboring space has already been visited, then we don't want our BFS to process that space again.

Doing so in the above example would be like trying to run the BFS on the previously explored node C from node E instead of the non-visited node K.

Initialize another list to be the **non-visited** neighbors. 

For each neighboring space, if the neighboring space is <u>not a wall and has not been visited yet</u> then add this neighbor to the list of non-visited neighbors. 

Then return this list.
