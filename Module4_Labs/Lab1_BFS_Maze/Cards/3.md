Spaces in the maze are represented with " . ". When a space(" . ") is read then the function 
`getAdjacentSpaces()` should get all neighbors of that space in a given maze. Each space will have four neighbours. These neighbours can either be walls or paths. Paths will be marked as visited or not visited. Initially all the paths will be marked not visited. 

The function `getAdjacentSpaces()` should return a list of neighbors that have not been visited. Neighbors in this case mean the possible paths one can go in the maze.

* Make sure to check if the space is actually accessible and not a wall!
