# Updating your result with the answer

You need to look at the integers in groups of 3, so you can iterate through all of the elements in increments of 1 and reference the other two elements with s[i - 2] and s[i - 1]. Make sure you do not go out of bounds.
Determine if a trio of numbers "ABC" can be written as "AB + C" or "A + BC" using a nested **if-else statement**

Ex: "22X" where X is some number, can be 2 + 2X after you check, but then you have to check whether 22 + X is also a combination depending on what X is

If X is <= 6, then you can have 2 + 26 or 22 + 6, but if it is 7 or greater, than you cannot have 2 + 27 because 27 does not map to any letter
