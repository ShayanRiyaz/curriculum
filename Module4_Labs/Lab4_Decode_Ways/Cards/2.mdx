# Creating a datastructure for your result
Pick a data structure for which to update your answer in. Each element will hold the maximum amount of combinations possible for each iteration of your loop. For element 0 of this return list, you will have the max number of combinations for the first element of the input string. The next element of the return list will hold the number of combinations of the first element plus the amount of combinations for the second iteration, etc.
You will use this data structure to return the cumulative number of combinations as you iterate through each element of the input string.
At the end, you will return the largest number in this result list, which should be the last element, since its elements are a cumulative amount.
