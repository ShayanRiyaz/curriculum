# Any length n

When there are three characters "ABC", there are at most three combinations:

* A + B + C

* A + BC
* AB + C

When there are four characters "ABC", there are at most five ways

* AB + CD
* A + B + C + D
* A + B + CD
* AB + C + D
* A + BC + D

It also depends on whether "AB" can be interpreted as "AB" or not

Example: Let A = 2 and B = 7, then "AB" is "27". Twenty-seven cannot map to a letter, so "AB" is not a valid combination, but "2" (B) and "7" (G) can. So there is only 1 combination for "27".



Try to find a pattern to solve the problem for any length of the input string.
Look at characters in groups of three, so for "12345", you would evaluate
1. "123"
2. "234"
3. "345"
