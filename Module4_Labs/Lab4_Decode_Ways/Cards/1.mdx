# Alphabet or Numbers

A message containing letters from A-Z is being encoded to numbers using the following mapping:
```python
'A' -> 1
'B' -> 2
...
'Z' -> 26
```
Given a non-empty string containing only digits, determine the total number of ways to decode it.

**Example 1:**
```python
Input: "12"
Output: 2
Explanation: It could be decoded as "AB" (1 2) or "L" (12).
```
**Example 2:**
```python
Input: "226"
Output: 3
Explanation: It could be decoded as "BZ" (2 26), "VF" (22 6), or "BBF" (2 2 6).
```

First, write some base cases to solve this problem.
