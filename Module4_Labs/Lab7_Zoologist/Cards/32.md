##### Step 1: Key

Each iteration of insertion sort, we choose an element of the array to be the **key**. Every element gets to be the **key** starting from the beginning of the array and going all the way to the end.

#####Step 2: Swap Round

Within each iteration, we compare the key to the value to its left. If the key is **smaller** than the element to its right, we swap them and repeat the process until either the key

1. Does not need to be swapped anymore
2. Reaches the end of the array

#####Step 3: Repeat

The algorithm is repeated until there are no more **keys** left to choose from. This is what a full sort looks like:
