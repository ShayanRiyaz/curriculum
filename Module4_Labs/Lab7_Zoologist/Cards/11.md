`Animals.txt` is a **file** that contains an `int` followed by a `string`. To read this content in a `dictionary`, you should use `open()` and `for` loops to **split** each line of the content of the text file into a **dictionary**. 

`open()` takes a file as an argument, but it's best not to send `Animals.txt` into the function directly. 

After initializing a dictionary, make sure to split the file in your for loop, so you can access the `int` and the `string`, and assign them as keys and values in your dictionary line by line. 

The integer should be the **key** and the animal should be the **value**.

Example of **dictionary**:

```python
5: Himalayan wolf
```
