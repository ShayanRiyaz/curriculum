To code our input parsing part, we will have a boolean variable called `invalidInput` and initialize its value as `True`.

```python
invalidInput = True
```

The rest of this part will be enveloped in a while loop that will stop once a valid input has been entered.

```python
while (invalidInput):
```

Here we print out the prompt for the user and set up the **input** to be taken in.

```python
    print("Please chose a sorting method:")
    print("1.(Bubble) Sort")
    print("2.(Insertion) Sort")
    print("3.(Selection) Sort")
    x=input("")
```

Following that are our **if-else** statements that are written according to the prompt. `If` any of these if statements are satisfied then we will set the boolean variable `invalidInput` to False, this means that our input is valid and therefore we will terminate from the while loop. If any of the prompt is not satisfied then the `invalidInput` variable remains True and we will repeat the loop for user prompt again.

```python
    while(invalidInput):
    
        #write the user prompt here as mentioned before
    
        if(x=="1"or x=="bubble"):
            #perform bubble sort here
            invalidInput=False
        elif(x=="2"or x=="insertion"):
            #perform insertion sort here
            invalidInput=False
        elif(x=="3"or x=="selection"):
            #perform selection sort here
            invalidInput=False
        else:
            print("Not a valid input, try again.")
```
