Bubble sort repeatedly compares adjacent elements and swaps them if they are out of order. Starting from the left side of the array, each element is compared to its right neighbor and swapped if it is bigger, until the end of the array is reached. The same process is repeated from the left side of the array all over again until no more swaps are required and thus the array is sorted.

This is an example of the first pass starting from the left:

The next pass for the preceding image example would start from the first index with **4**, where no swap would take place. Then **5** and **1** would swap, **5** and **0** would swap and so on so forth.
