Bubble sort repeatedly compares adjacent elements and swaps them if they are out of order.

#####Step 1: First Round of Swaps

Starting from the left side of the array, each element is compared to its right neighbor. If the right neighbor is smaller, the two are swapped, otherwise nothing happens. Then we move on to the next element and its right neighbor, until the end of the array is reached. This is an example of one pass starting from the left:

##### Step 2: N-Rounds of Swaps

The same process is repeated from the left side of the array all over again until no more swaps are required and thus the array is sorted. For example, the next pass for the preceding image example would start from the first index with **4**, where no swap would take place. Then **5** and **1** would swap, **5** and **0** would swap and so on so forth.
