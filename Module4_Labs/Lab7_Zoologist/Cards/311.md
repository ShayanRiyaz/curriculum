The core of the algorithm checks the relationship between the values of adjacent pairs in the array. This is done in the **if statement** within a **for loop**:

```python
	if (arr[j] > arr[j+1]):
    arr[j], arr[j+1] = arr[j+1], arr[j]
```

`arr[j]` represents the left element of the pair, while `arr[j+1]` represents the right element of the pair.

```python
for i in range(0, len(arr)):
	for j in range(0, len(arr)-1-i):
```

The if statement is nested inside two for loop so we can continue checking adjacent pairs after only doing one swap, for every element in the array. If the algorithm does one swap and moves on to the next element, the sort might be incomplete!

We must have one **outer** for loop to run the algorithm for each element, and one **inner** for loop to run multiple swaps per selected element, if need be.

#####Ascending Order

If we want to swap and sort in **ascending order**, a swap occurs when the left pair is bigger than the right pair. Thus the condition for the swap is simply a comparison between the value of the array elements to see if the left one is bigger: `(arr[j] > arr[j+1])`.

##### Descending Order

If we want to sort in **descending order**, we change the operator of the conditional statement to be `<` instead of `>`.
