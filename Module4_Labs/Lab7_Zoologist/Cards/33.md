#####Step 1: Traverse

In selection sort, we traverse the array from the left end to the right end. Each element is considered thus we can use a **for loop**.

#####Step 2: Find Min And Swap

For each iteration, we want to find the minimum element in the **remainder** of the list, and swap it with the **current element**. The algorithm finishes when the last element in the array is considered.
