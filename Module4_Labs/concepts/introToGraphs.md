There are two types of graphs - undirected and directed.

The following is an example of a directed graph:

Here is an example of an undirected graph:

The key difference between these two graphs is that directed graphs have an arrow on their edges which point to the direction of that edge
while undirected graphs do not.

Graphs can be used to represent a variety of things. They are used to represent networks like a newtwork of airplane routes or a network of
water pipes. They are also used in social media like Facebook to represent connections between users.

Graphs are commonly stored in two different ways: adjacency lists and adjacency matrices.

The adjacency list of a given node is the list of all other nodes that are adjacent to that node.
An adjacency matrix is a 2D array of size NxN where N is the number of nodes in the graph. In each cell of the array there is either a 
1 or a 0 to represent if the node is adjacent or not.

Adjacency lists take up less space than adjacency matrices, but are slower in determining whether or not a node has an edge to another.
