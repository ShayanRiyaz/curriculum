# Hash Tables - Quadratic Probing

### Motivation

In Hash Tables, when there is a collision, we must have a collision resolution technique when keys are hashed to the same bucket. Quadratic Probing is an example of a collision resolution technique. This technique is a part of open addressing.

### How it Works

Quadratic probing is best demonstrated through an example.
