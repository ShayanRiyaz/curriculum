# Insertion Sort

Insertion Sort is another one of our four basic sorting algorithms in Python. As with all sorting algorithms in Python, the purpose of Insertion is to work with groups of data.  For example, if we are trying to sort a list of values from Biggest to smallest; Insertion Sort works by grabbing one element, and comparing it the element next to it. If the element is smaller, we pass that element and keep passing elements until we reach an element that is greater than the element we grabbed. We then insert that element in that place holder, and grab a new one.

### When should I use Insertion Sort? 

* insertion sort is most useful when working with data sets that are partially sorted through and only have a few misplaced items. Insertion sort is also useful when the data set is small. 
* Note that Insertion Sort runs in O(n^2^) time.
