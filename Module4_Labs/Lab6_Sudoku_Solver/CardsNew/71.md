# testPossible()

We first need to duplicate our `grid` to preserve the original `grid` since we are modifying the duplicate by storing the value `n` at the square (`r`,`c`):

### Check if duplicate is successful

Once we input the user's guess into `duplicate`, we need to check if `duplicate` will succeed. This is done through our function `complete()`,  which takes as arguments the grid (`duplicate` in this case) and the integer `depth`. 

If duplicate is successful, then all we need to do left is check if `finish` is true. If so, then we will copy `duplicate` back to grid since we now have a solution!
