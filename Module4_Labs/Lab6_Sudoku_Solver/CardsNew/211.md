# isValid() Function

```python
def isValid(grid)
  for row in grid:
    for i in row:
      # We will fill in the code as we progress through the card.
      
  for c in range(0,9):
    for r in range (0,9):
      # We will fill in the code as we progress through the card.
      
  return True
```

For our first nested for-loop, we will define an empty list called `found` within the outer-loop:

```python
	# Check that all rows contain no repeats
  for row in grid:
		found = []
		for i in row:
```

As we iterate through the elements within a row, we will store the elements into `found` to determine if any of the remaining elements in that row exists in `found` already- which indicates that there is a repeated value in that row. 

```python
	# Check that all rows contain no repeats
	for row in grid:
		found = []
		for i in row:
			if i in found:
				return False
			if i != 0:
				found.append(i)
```

Within the inner-loop, we check if `i`, the current element in `row`, exists inside of `found` as stated earlier. If `i` is indeed inside of `found`, then we return False to indicate that there was a repeated value in the row. Otherwise, we append element `i`  into `found` if `i != 0` (because we do not want to care to append blank/empty spaces).

Now moving onto the next nested for-loop to check for repeated values in columns, we will also intialize an empty list `found` for the same reason as implemented above.

```python
	# Check that all columns contain no repeats
  for c in range(0,9):
		found = []
		for r in range(0,9):
```

Then we will use `i` to assign to `grid[r][c]`  in order to iterate through all the values within each column to  check for repeats. If `i` (the value within a particular column `c`) is not in `found` and does not equal to 0 (a empty space), then we will append the value to `found`.

```python
	# Check that all columns contain no repeats
	for c in range(0,9):
		found = []
		for r in range(0,9):
			i = grid[r][c]
			if i in found:
				return False
			if i != 0:
				found.append(i)

	return True
```

Now notice that for the second nested for-loop, we are iterating through  `range(0,9)`, which is looping from 0 to 9, in both inner and outer loops. This is because we must iterate through each `row` at the same index in order to compare the elements within the same column since our `grid` is a list of rows.

For example, if we check all the values for the first column (`c == 0`), we will iterate through the rows (`r`) from `0-9`.

At last, we have our final function `isValid()`:

```python
def isValid(grid):
	# Check that all rows contain no repeats
	for row in grid:
		found = []
		for i in row:
			if i in found:
				return False
			if i != 0:
				found.append(i)

	# Check that all columns contain no repeats
	for c in range(0,9):
		found = []
		for r in range(0,9):
			i = grid[r][c]
			if i in found:
				return False
			if i != 0:
				found.append(i)

	return True
```
