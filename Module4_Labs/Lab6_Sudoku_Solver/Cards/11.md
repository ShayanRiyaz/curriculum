# printGrid()

Now remember that our grid is a 2-D matrix, formatted as a 9x9 which means that we have a list containing 9 rows that have 9 elements each. We will need a **nested for-loop** i.e two **for-loops** and two variables for **indexing**: one variable to iterate through the rows in `grid`, and another variable to iterate through the elements in the each list within `grid`.  

(image to go here )

In the first for-loop,`row_index` (say represented with variable "i") will be used to iterate through the rows in our `grid`. In the second for-loop, `index`(say reprsented with variable "j") will be used to iterate through each`element` in the corresponding row.

Within each for-loop, all that's left is a series of if/if-else statements with logic that will be used to format the Sudoku board to be printed. At the end of each `row` we generate, we then print `rowString` to progressively print out our board row by row.
