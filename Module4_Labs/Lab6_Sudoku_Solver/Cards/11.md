# printGrid()

Now remember that our grid is a 2-D list formatted as a 9x9 which means that we have a list containing 9 lists that each have 9 numbers. Thus, we will need a **nested for-loop** which consists of two **for-loops** and two variables for **indexing**: one variable to iterate through the lists in `grid`, and another variable to iterate through the elements in the each list within  `grid`.
