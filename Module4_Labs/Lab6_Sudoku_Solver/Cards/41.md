# findPossible() Function

As said earlier, `findPossible()` will result in a list of possible valid values for a spot by observing the given spot's row, column, and nonet. 

Here are some hints and conditions that you should keep in mind while trying to come up with how to implement this function:

* If a spot is **not** blank, a value has already been placed, and, thus, there is no "possible" values for us to find
* We need to store all possible values and find a way to remove values that are not valid, so that we are only left with possible values
* We are given `r_i` and `c_i`. This is the location of the target square which we can use this information to iterate through the same row, column, and box. For going through the row, column, and box, keep in mind the dimensions of each box and the board as a whole.
