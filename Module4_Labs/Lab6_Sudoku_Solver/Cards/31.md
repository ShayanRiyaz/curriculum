# Working Within a Box

Since we wish to return elements **not** currently in a box, we need to initialize a list with all the elements that could possibly be in an **empty** box. Then we would need to traverse through this list and remove the elements that cannot be in the **specific** box we are observing.

As a hint, you will need nested for loops and should keep in mind that the box's dimensions are 3x3.
