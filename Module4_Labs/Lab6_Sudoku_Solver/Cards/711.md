# testPossible()

On the condition that `complete()` returns True in our if-statement, we will check if `finish` evaluates to True also:

```python
	if complete(duplicate,depth):
		if finish:
```

Then we know that `duplicate` was successful in regards to completion, so we now want `duplicate` to be our `grid` since `duplicate` is now the solution. Thus we will use a nested for-loop to overwrite all the values in `grid` with `duplicate`:

```python
			for r in range(0,9):
				for c in range(0,9):
					grid[r][c] = duplicate[r][c]
```

In the end of that we just return True if we succeeded and otherwise False. Therefore, our final `testPossible()` function will appear as below:

```python
# Checks if it can find a solution given a grid, and then a row-column pair with a value to try.
# If it finds a solution and finish is true, then it sets the grid to the solution so as to speed it up.
def testPossible(grid,r,c,n,depth,finish):
	duplicate = copy.deepcopy(grid)
	duplicate[r][c] = n
	if complete(duplicate,depth):
		if finish:
			for r in range(0,9):
				for c in range(0,9):
					grid[r][c] = duplicate[r][c]
		return True
	else:
		return False
```
