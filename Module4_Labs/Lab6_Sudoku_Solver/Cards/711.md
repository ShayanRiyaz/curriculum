# testPossible()

We first need to duplicate our `grid` to preserve the original `grid` since we are modifying the duplicate by storing the value `n` at the square (`r`,`c`):

```python
def testPossible(grid,r,c,n,depth,finish):
	duplicate = copy.deepcopy(grid)
	duplicate[r][c] = n
```

Note that in order to use the built-in function `copy.deepcopy()`, one must import the Python library `copy`.
