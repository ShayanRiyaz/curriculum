# nextMove()

Following our function header, we will first initialize another local boolean variable called `foundMove` which will be initially set to `False` until we have found a move in one of our three clauses. 

For our first clause, we will start with the easy case which would iterate through all spots to check if there is clearly only one possible value that could replace an empty square. Thus, we will need a nested for-loop that iterates through all possible square (totaling 81). This will look as such:

Remember that we will be using our `findPossible()` function to aid us in finding a possible answer for any/every empty square if possible. If we find a move, then you should print the value to be in place for the current square as seen previously.

â€‹	   Such as this **example**: `(8,9) -> 1  [Only possible]`

All that's left for this clause is implementing the remaining logic in the case of finding a possible value via `findPossible()` and otherwise, you will output nothing and just move onto clause 2.
