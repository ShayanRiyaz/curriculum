# testPossible()

Here are some specific hints about how to approach this problem:

- You will have to figure out a way to preserve the state of the grid, even when we are storing the value `n` at the row, column pair (`r`, `c`). This is needed to ensure the board maintains itself, even if the user guesses wrong. (Hint: duplication of the board)
- Additionally, you will have to check if the user's guess is correct. You should be using a function you *completed* (big hint) earlier as part of achieving this. Also consider how you will update the grid if a solution has been found.
