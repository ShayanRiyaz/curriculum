As per the activity, directed graphs are represented through their node and their edges. So within a file system, each file or folder is a node and each "parent" folder has an edge connecting it to its child folder or file.

The parent/child relationship can be found through reading doing some manipulations on the "structural" number provided. The entire number is mapped to the name of the folder to the right of it, but the first few numbers correlate to the parent folders.

Here is a diagram of the file structure with the root and subfolder, etc. Make sure to study the file structure before moving onto the coding details.
