As per the activity, directed graphs are represented through their node and their edges. So within a file system, each file or folder is a node and each "parent" folder has an edge connecting it to its child folder or file.

The parent/child relationship can be found through reading and doing some manipulations on the "structural" number provided. The entire number is mapped to the name of the folder to the right of it, but the first few numbers correlate to the parent folders.

Make sure to understand the heiarchy of the folders before moving to coding.
