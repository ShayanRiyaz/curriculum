To write your graph class well, it should be really easy to insert edges into the graph. Each edge has a "from" and a "to" node, making it representable by a 2 dimensional **tuple**. Because the edges are directed, the order of the elements in the tuple matters!

Now would be a great time to contemplate how the "from-to" relationship is represented in the input file and use that information to contemplate the direction of your arrows and how you should store information in the tuple.

![Please only contemplate the directions of your edges, not your life. Existential crises are not part of this lab.](https://images.pexels.com/photos/38640/directory-traffic-note-shield-38640.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&dpr=2&h=750&w=1260)

Now in order to create the Graph, we have to have a Graph **constructor**, in which we have to initialize any **attributes** it may have. Those attributes would be the nodes and the edges since they are the core foundation of forming the graph in the 1st place. 

Lets first focus on adding the edges attribute and the associated function. If we want to add elements into the edges attribute, we should write a method which adds the edges on by one.
