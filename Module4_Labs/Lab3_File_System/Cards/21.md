To write your graph class well, it should be really easy to insert edges into the graph. Each edge has a "from" and a "to" node, making it representable by a 2 dimensional **tuple**. Because the edges are directed, the order of the elements in the tuple matters!

The first element of a tuple represents the "from" end of an arrow, while the second element represents the "to" end. Getting the directions of the arrows wrong is considered wrong when testing your code.

Now would be a great time to contemplate how the "from-to" relationship is represented in the input file and use that information to contemplate the direction of your arrows.

![Please only contemplate the directions of your edges, not your life. Existential crises are not part of this lab.](https://images.pexels.com/photos/38640/directory-traffic-note-shield-38640.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&dpr=2&h=750&w=1260)

To add edges to a graph, we first have to initialize a graph. This is done through writing:

```python
G2 = Graph()
```

To be able to create a new Graph object, we have to have a Graph **constructor**, in which we have to initialize any **attributes** it may have. In our case, the edges and the values of the nodes are the most important, so we are going to store them as attributes:

```python
def __init__(self):
	self.edges = defaultdict(list)
	self.val_map = {}
```

To add elements into the edges attribute, we should write a method which adds the edges on by one. Since it is a directed graph, we should accept a `from_node` and a `to_node`:

```python
def add_edge(self, from_node, to_node):
	self.edges[from_node].append(to_node)
```

`from_node` is the node at the "tail" of the edge and `to_node` is the node at the "head" of the edge. Essentially, in `addEdge`, we are forming an edge starting at `from_node` to `to_node` by storing `to_node` in the adjacency list of `from_node`.
