Previously, we initialized an attribute called `val_map` in the constructor. This attribute is of type dictionary because it can easily be used to represent **key-value** pairs, with the key as the node (structural number) and the value as the name of the folder or file.

**Step 1: Create `add_val_map` function**

In the previous step, when reading the file, we had already stored the nodes and their corresponding values as a dictionary, so it would be easy to add it to the graph that way.

We write a method that accepts a dictionary as a parameter to store each key-value pair for our nodes and save the value of this parameter to our `val_map` attribute:

```python
def add_val_map(self, val_map):
	self.val_map = val_map
```

**Step 2: Use `add_val_map` function**

Once we have created this method, we would create a graph and then add this key-value pair into our graph:

```python
G.add_val_map(val_map)
```

The importance of utilizing this method is that we can organize the values of our nodes based on numerical order. This method also helps in giving our graph the ability to add new nodes for itself.
