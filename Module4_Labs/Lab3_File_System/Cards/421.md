**Step 1: Call nx.draw() to draw the roots that will connect each node for the graph**

In order to tell the `matplotlib` library what the graph is going to look like, we need to call the `nx.draw()` function.  Here, we provide the graph (`G2`), the positioning (`pos`), and we let the function know that we don't want the labels it would assign by setting `with_labels` to `False` (i.e we want to tell it what the labels should be).

```python
    nx.draw(G2, pos = pos, with_labels = False) 
```
**Step 2: Call draw_networkx_labels() to label each node**

Now, we want to let `matplotlib` know what the labels of each node should be. To do this we use the `draw_networkx_labels()` function from `networkx`. Again, we provide `G2` and `pos`,  but now we also give the labels that are mapped to each node (`val_map`) and specify the font size of the labeling to `8`.

```python
    nx.draw_networkx_labels(G2, pos, val_map, 8)
```
**Step 3: Call plt.show() to show the final visual for our graph**

Lastly, in order to actually see the graph, we use the `matplotlib` function `show()`.  Here, since we have already told `matplotlib` what we want to show, we just have to call the function:

```python
    plt.show()
```

Now if you run the code, you should be able to see our graph visually!
