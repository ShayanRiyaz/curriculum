**Transversing through the Stack**

This part of the traversal is where the actual *traversing* happens. 

You are going to want to continually do these following operations until your `stack` is empty:

**Step 1: Obtain a new `start`**

**Step 2: Write that the information associated with that `start` to the output file**

**Step 3: Sort the list of edges connecting to `start`**

**Step 4: Check all the edges from the given `start ` and put them on the `stack` to go there**
