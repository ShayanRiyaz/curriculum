Let's review `DFS` as a concept before we dive into its application to this specific problem. `DFS` is an algorithm which traverses a graph (directed or undirected) through the use of a data structure called a `stack` (Last-In First-Out). We start with a given start node, mark that it has been visited, and push its unvisited neighbors to the stack. We then pop the top node off of the stack, mark it as visited, and repeat this process until all the nodes have been visited. 

Hopefully that rings a bell. Its important to have a fundamental understanding of `DFS` to understand and complete this part of the lab. As always, if needed, you can refer back to the activities which discuss `DFS` in depth (no pun intended!)

Let's get to the specifics of this problem now.

You need to create a `visited`  `defaultdict(bool)`. We have to use a `defaultdict` because we need to index our `visited` by the string that identifies a given node, i.e `"011"`. 

```python
        visited = defaultdict(bool)
```

A `stack` must be created since it will hold which nodes we need to visit next, unlike a `queue` here it will enable us to print out our "folders" in the correct relative order:

```python
		stack = []
```

Since we want to start with `start`, we need to push it onto our stack

```python
		stack.append(start)
```

And since we are pushing `start` onto our stack that means we will have already visited it, so we need to mark it as such:

```python
		visited[start] = True
```
