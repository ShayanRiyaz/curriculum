Let's break down the folder structure. In our actual problem, all of the folders will have an associated name, but for now, we are focusing on understanding how the folder **numbers** relate to one another.

* `0` is the root folder
* `01` , `02`, and `03` are all children of the root folder. This can be seen by the **directed** edge starting from the root, going towards `01`, `02`, and `03` respectively.
*  `011` , `012`, and `013` are all children of the `01` folder. This can be seen by the **directed** edge starting from `01`, going towards `011`, `012`, and `013` respectively.

Look at the numbering scheme. Do you notice anything interesting?
