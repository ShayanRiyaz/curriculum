**Step 12: Sort edges that connect to start**

Before we check all of the edges `start` connects to, we need to make sure the files are in the correct order. To do this we sort all of the edges that `start` connects to:

```python
lst = self.edges[start]
lst.sort()
```
**Step 13: Reverse the list**

Now that the list is sorted we need to reverse the list since we are using a `stack` (Last In First Out):

```python
lst = lst[::-1]
```
**Step 14: Iterate through the list**

We need to loop through `lst` since it holds all of the vertices that `start` connects to:

```python
for j in lst:
```
**Step 15: Check if you gave visited the vertex**

Again, we need to check if we have been to that vertex:

```python
if visited[j] == False: 
```
**Step 16: Given that you haven't visited the vertex, append it to the Stack**

If we haven't we will add the vertex to our `stack`:

```python
stack.append(j)
```
**Step 17: Verify that you have visited the vertex**

And mark that we have visited that vertex:

```python
visited[j] = True
```

Here is the above (and previous) code fragments shown together:

```python
while stack:
  start = stack.pop()
  f = open("output.txt", "a")
  f.write(start+'. ' +   self.val_map[start] + '\n')
  f.close()
  lst = self.edges[start]
  lst.sort()
  lst = lst[::-1]
  for j in lst:
    if visited[j] == False: 
      stack.append(j)
      visited[j] = True
```
