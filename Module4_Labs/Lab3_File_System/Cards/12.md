Once we understand the numbering scheme, we move onto the programatical details.

We have to figure out how to: 

**Step 1: Read in the file using Python** 

**Step 2: Organize the numbers of each of the folders while maintaining the correct graph hierarchy.**

Here are a few hints:

* When you are reading in each line from the file, you will have to seperate the folder number from the name of the folder
* A tuple will be useful in organizing the numbers we read in from the file into appropriate edges.
