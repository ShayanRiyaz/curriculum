In the previous easy card, we initialized an **attribute** called `val_map` in the constructor. This attribute is of a type dictionary because it can easily be represented as a **key-value** pair, with the key as the node and the value as the name of the folder or file.

**Step 1: Create `add_val_map` Function**

In the previous step, when reading the file, we had already stored the nodes and their corresponding values as a dictionary, so it would be easy to add it to the graph that way.

We write a method that accepts a dictionary as a parameter to store each **key-value** pair for our node:

```python
def add_val_map(self, val_map):
	self.val_map = val_map
```

**Step 2: Use `add_val_map` Function**

Once we have created this method, we would create a graph and then add this **key-value** pair into our graph:

```python
G2.add_val_map(val_map)
```

The importance of utilizing this method is that we can organize the values of our nodes based on numerical order and we'll give our graph the ability to add new nodes for itself.
