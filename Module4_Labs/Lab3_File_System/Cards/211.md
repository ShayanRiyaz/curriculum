It should now make sense *why* properly determining which node is `from_node` and which node is `to_node` affects arrow direction and our algorithm correctness. The arrows of our directed graph start at `from_node` (parent node) and go towards `to_node` (child node). If we flipped this in our code, and had `from_node` point to `to_node`, we would get incorrect results, as we would have our child folder be the parent of our parent folder! 

From the previous code, we should have constructed a list of edges from the file as we were reading it in, storing the parent as the tuple's first element, and it's child as it's second element. But since our function only adds one edge at a time, we have to add the edge as we iterate through the graph:

```python
for edge in edges:
  G2.add_edge(*edge)
```
