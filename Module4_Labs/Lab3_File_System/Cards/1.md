We will be representing a simple file structure with a directed graph. You will receive a text file on which to base it off of. The file will contain many file and folder names written in the format: `###. some words`. Each node that you will input within the graph will always have some relation to the original parent node in order to represent the connnection that the node shares with its ancestor nodes. The following is an example of a file you could receive.

```
0. Friends
01. Season 1
011. Seinfeld
012. The Big Bang Theory
013. Cheers
02. Season 2
021. Parks and Recreation
022. How I Met Your Mother
...
```

- the numbers represent the "level" of the folder/file. `0` is the root folder, `01` is a subfolder of `0`, `011` is a subfolder of `01`, and so on and so forth. 
- In the example above, `0. Friends` would be the root, while `01. Season 1` would be its subfolder. We can see here that with `0` being  the initial folder of our file, each subfolder has some relationship with the original folder. In this case, we can see here that `0` is the root folder for the show `Friends`. 
- Based off of this, the `01. Season 1` would be the subfolder that would recommend shows that are similar in viewership and content to `0. Friends`, hence explaining why nodes `011` to `013` are related to `0. Friends`. 
- The same could be said for the `02. Season 2` subfolder containg shows that are similar to the second season of `0. Friends`. This example will create a recommendation system in which the structure would recommend seasons of shows that are very similar to the seasons of the root folder in the file. The following are assumptions you can make about the folder numbers:
  - you can assume that the level or the number of folders/files per level will never surpass `9`
  - you can assume that the root will always be `0`
- `some words` represents the "name" of the folder/file, similar to how you would name your folders

In the first part of the program, you will be required to:

* Parse the file to obtain the structural numbers *and* the names of the folders/files 

In later stages of the lab, you will:

* Find a way to represent these components in a directed graph
* Display the graph using `networkx` and redirect the output to a file 


This lab serves to illustrate, from start to finish, a practical application of directed graphs. Upon completing this lab, you should learn about the sorts of situations in which one would ideally choose a directed graph as their data structure implementation.
