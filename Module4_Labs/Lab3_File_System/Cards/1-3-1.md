# steps

## 1-3-1 Step 1

### name

```
Map the structural number to the folder name
```

### md_content

```
Recall that we split each line that we read in. This means that `dirAndVal[0]` stores the structural number and `dirAndVal[1]` stores the folder name. We can simply make a dictionary (`val_map`) out of this. When you have finished reading the file, you will have made a list of edges and a dictionary of every node and its corresponding name.
```

### code_snippet

```python
val_map[dirAndVal[0]] = dirAndVal[1]
```
