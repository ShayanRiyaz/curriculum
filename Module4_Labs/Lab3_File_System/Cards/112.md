You should notice that you can obtain the parent folder number directly from the child number folder itself!

*  `01`, `02` , and `03` have the root folder (`0`) as its parent, because its first digit is `0`.
* `011`, `012` , and `013` have folder `01` as its parent, because its first **two** digits are `01`.

Everything except the last digit of a folder tells you i parent folder number!

Check your understanding. Make sure you can answer the following question before moving for:

* What is the number of the parent folder of folder `0121` (not in diagram)?
