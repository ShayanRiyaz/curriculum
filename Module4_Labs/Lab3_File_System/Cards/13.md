So far, we have only focused on understanding the numbering scheme of the folders. How will we account for the fact that each number has an associated name? How will we store this information when reading the file?

**Step 1: Understand Conceptually How to Store Information in Graph Node**

We can store the names of each of these files as the **value** of a node, each **node** being the unique structural number that is associated with each name. Recall in the activity that we can map the values to the nodes after we have defined the edges.

Assume that you will never have to add edges to undefined nodes.

**Step 2: Understand Programmatically How to Store Values in Directed Graph**

In the activity, a dictionary was used to pass in the values to the directed graph; you should do the same.

This will be the last step in completing the function related to reading in the file and storing its information. Once you have completed the function pertaining to reading in and storing the input file's information, you should call this function from the `main` function.
