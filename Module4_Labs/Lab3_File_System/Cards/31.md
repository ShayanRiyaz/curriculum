**Step 1: Use the hieracrhy_pos() function to order the positioning of each node**

To get the correct `pos` we need to look at how we can use the provided `hierarchy_pos()` function. 

`hierarchy_pos()` is a function designed to make the graphs layout hierarchical (it had to be made separately because the `networkx` did not have a predefined hierarchical layout). 

**Step 2: Input a graph argument into our hierarchy_pos() parameter**

We can see from the function that the first argument it needs is the graph `G`, which luckily we already have! 

However, when you look at the rest of the arguments, what do you notice? They all are already assigned values! So what else do we need to provide as an argument besides just `G` ?

Think about how you can identify the root of the graph you made. If you can, just provide that as the second argument, and you'll have your `pos`.
