# steps

## 3-2-1 Step 1

### name

```
Iterate through the `stack` until it's empty
```

### md_content

```
In order to visit all of the nodes at least once, we need to keep going until the `stack` is empty.
```

### code_snippet

```python
while stack: 
```
## 3-2-1 Step 2

### name

```
Pop the last node from `stack` to visit other nodes
```

### md_content

```
Now, we need a new vertex to visit. In order to do that, we just need to pop the last value off of the `stack` and save it in `start`.
```

### code_snippet

```python
start = stack.pop()
```
## 3-2-1 Step 3

### name

```
Write to a new file
```

### md_content

```
We need to write all of the information associated with `start` to a new file.

The second parameter `a` signifies that we are appending to the file.
```

### code_snippet

```python
f = open("output.txt", "a")
```
## 3-2-1 Step 4

### name

```
Replicate the structure of the original file
```

### md_content

```
We are now writing the correct information to the file here. `start` holds the identifier for a particular node. We know that we have the "file names" in `val_map` so we use those as well to replicate the structure of the file we were originally given.
```

### code_snippet

```python
f.write(start+'. ' + self.val_map[start] + '\n')
```
## 3-2-1 Step 5

### name

```
Close your newly made file after opening it
```

### md_content

```
Even though we are coming back to this file to work on it later, it is good practice to always close the file after opening it.
```

### code_snippet

```python
f.close()
```

## 3-2-1 Step 6

### name

```
All the code shown together
```

### md_content

```
Here is the previous code fragments shown together.

At this point, we have saved the node that we are currently observing into `start`. Once we get this node, we are writing its information to the output file. Think about what more is required for us to do. 
```

### code_snippet

```python
while stack:
  start = stack.pop()
  f = open("output.txt", "a")
  f.write(start+'. ' +   self.val_map[start] + '\n')
  f.close()
```
