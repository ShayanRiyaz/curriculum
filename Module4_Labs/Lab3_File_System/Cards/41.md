**Implementing the DFS Algorithm**

As mentioned before, we are going to be implementing a `DFS` style traversal function. 

**Step 1: Check if you have visited a previous node**

First you need to think about how we will keep track of "where you've been" when traversing. Trying thinking how using a `defaultdict(bool)` will enable you to see if you have been to a given node. 

**Step 2: Make sure that you start on the initial root**

Once you have those set up, you need to make sure you're going to start on the root, `start`, and therefore mark it as visited.
