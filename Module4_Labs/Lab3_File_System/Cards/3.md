Since you are given the Graph `G`, and a map with each node's value, `val_map`, you will need to be using both of these in conjunction with `networkx` functions to visually see your graph. The purpose of `val_map` is to assign each node a number so that once you insert each node into the graph, it would be inserted by numerical order. 

First, you need to make sure the graph prints in a "tree" orientation. By default the graph will not be shown as we want it to appear. We would like it to appear as a hierarchal, "tree-like" graph, which is oriented like such:

From the above diagram, one can see that a "tree-like" graph is one in which there are no cycles and there is a parent-child relationship; that is, there is a direct edge between the parent and child. Not every node needs children, but every child node (except the root), will have an associated parent node.

In order to achieve this, you must set the positioning, `pos`,  of the graph's nodes by using the `hierarchy_pos()` function we have provided. `pos` refers to the position of each node and the reason on why this function is important is because we can find the precise location to input each node in our graph. Basically, the `hierarchy_pos()` function manually alters the nodes positions, `pos`,  in order to have them oriented in the above manner. This needs to be done manually because `networkx`  currently does not have a predefined layout option to represent a graph in a hierarchal manner. Since that is the case, we would call the `hierarchy_pos()` function to ensure that each node's position is situated properly to print the same result that we see in our connected graph.

Once this is achieved you can will need to use one of the `networkx`  functions that allow you to **draw** the graph, and another to **draw** the graph with **labels** so each node will hold it's filename. Then to actually see the graph, you will need to use the `matplotlib` function to **show** the graph. `matplotlib` is Python's visual library that creates graphs of mathematical models. The reason why we would use this library is because as mentioned before, `networkx` isn't capbable of producing the visual for the graph on its own.
