Let's focus on reading in the file.

**Step 1: Open File and Read Contents**

We have to open and read the file line by line in order to read every folder and its associated number:

```python
readFile = open("textOutline.txt", "r")
for line in readFile:
```

**Step 2: Separate Names from Numbers**

To separate the names from the numbers, we would have to split the line between the number and the words. In order to do that, we can use the built-in `split()` function. However that still leaves extra space before the name, so we will use the `strip()` function. Store these two parts in a list, named `dirAndVal` here:

```python
	dirAndVal = line.split(". ")
	dirAndVal[1] = dirAndVal[1].strip()
```
