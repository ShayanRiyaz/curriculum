# Bubblesort Algorithm

Bubblesort is one of our four types of basic sorting algorithms in Python. The purpose of Bubblesort is to sort through a series of numbers and sort the values out such that the largest values are first and the lower values are last. 

### How to do this? 

1. Compare the first two numbers, if they are not in order (larger number is on the left) then swap the two.
2. Move on from the first and compare the second and third values, swap if necessary.
3. Continue down the list until reaching the last index. At this point the largest value has been sorted.
4. Repeat from the first number and continue to the last unsorted index.

#### Why is it Useful?

* Use Bubblesort to quickly rearrange values
* A teacher could use Bubblesort to quickly shift through a large amount of test scores to find the highest and lowest scores
* A consumer looking for a new TV could sort a list of items to check for price
