# Quick Sort 

Quick Sort is one of our four basic sorting algorithims in Python. It is known as the most efficient and fastest of the four. 

Quick Sort in two basic simple steps would be: 

1. Quicksort determines a **pivot** point which would be an element in the dataset.
2. Next, using the pivot point, it ***partitions\*** (or divides) the larger unsorted collection into two, smaller lists. It then sorts the unsorted collection into two groups. Everything smaller is moved to the right/or left of the pivot point, and everything greater would be moved to the opposite direction of the pivot point.

Quick sort uses a *divide and conquer* strategy when working with data. After it creates two subgroups, it will then choose another pivot point with in that subgroup. The process then repeats until the entire data structure is organized. It then recombines all the subgroups back into one big group so the data structure is now organized. 

Here is a Visual Aide to demonstrate just how effective Quicksort is:
