# SH sequences

For this problem we need to find the number of sequences with:
- Length n
- 0 or 1 'F's
- No more than 2 in a row 'S's
- As many 'H's as we want

To make this problem simpler we can remove the `'F'`s from the equation early because there will only be 0 or 1 and focus on the problem of finding how many sequences of `'S'` and `'H'` we can have.

 

We need to find the number of SH (strike then a hit) sequences of length `n` + for every possible position of a single `'F'` we need to find the number of SH sequences to the left of the `'F'` times the number of SH sequences to the right of the `'F'`.
