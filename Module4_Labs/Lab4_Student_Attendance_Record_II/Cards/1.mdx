# Baseball Records
You are a programmer for a baseball team and want to reward exceptional behavior based on hit record.
Given a positive integer **n**, return the number of all possible hit records with length n, which will be regarded as rewardable.
The hit record is a string that only contains the following three characters:

* "H" for hit (a valid hit)
* "F" for foul (a hit, but the ball went out of bounds)
* "S" for strike (a miss)
A record is regarded as exceptional if it doesn't contain **more than one 'F' (foul)** or **more than two continuous 'S' (strike)**

**Example 1:**

```
Input: n = 2
Output: 8 
Explanation:
There are 8 records with length 2 will be regarded as rewardable:
"PP" , "AP", "PA", "LP", "PL", "AL", "LA", "LL"
Only "AA" won't be regarded as exceptional owing to more than one absent times. 
```

**Note:** The value of **n** won't exceed 100,000.

Use dynamic programming to determine how to store all the possible number of SH (strike then a hit) sequences.

This helps you by working with small data before you tackle the entire problem.
