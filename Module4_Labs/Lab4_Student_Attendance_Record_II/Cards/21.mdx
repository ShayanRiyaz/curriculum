# Extending to any length

If we store the number of SH sequences for every length `i` for `0 <= i <= n` in an array of length `n+1` then we know how many SHF (strike-hit-foul) sequences with this line of Python.

Now we need to compute how many SH sequences there are for any length. We will do this with a dynamic programming table.
