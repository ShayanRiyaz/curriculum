# Extending to any length

Here is our dynamic programming table.

```
     |  0  |  1  |  2  |  3  | ... | n
------------------------------
H    |     |     |     |     |
------------------------------
S    |     |     |     |     |
------------------------------
SS   |     |     |     |     |
------------------------------
sh   |     |     |     |     |
------------------------------
```

Now we want to fill the ith column with:
- H[i] being the number of possible sequences ending with 'H' of length i
- S[i] being the number of possible sequences ending with 'S' of length i
- SS[i] being the number of possible sequences ending with 'SS' of length i
- sh[i] being the number of possible SH sequences of length i

 

I think it is easiest to start with column `1`.

 

```
     |  0  |  1  |  2  |  3  | ... | n
------------------------------
H    |     |  1  |     |     |
------------------------------
S    |     |  1  |     |     |
------------------------------
SS   |     |  0  |     |     |
------------------------------
sh   |     |  2  |     |     |
------------------------------
```

If we have a subsequence of length `i` we know that we can:
 \- Always add a `'H'` to make the sequence end in `'H'`
 \- Add an `'S'` if the sequence ended in `'H'` to make the sequence end in `'S'`
 \- Add an `'S'` if the sequence ended in `'S'` to make the sequence end in `'SS'`

 

```
     |  0  |  1  |  2  |  3  | ... | n
------------------------------
H    |     |  1  |  2  |  4  |
------------------------------
S    |     |  1  |  1  |  2  |
------------------------------
SS   |     |  0  |  1  |  1  |
------------------------------
sh   |     |  2  |  4  |  7  |
------------------------------
```



As we fill in the table we can see that:
- H[i+1] == S[i]
- S[i+1] == H[i]
- SS[i+1] == S[i]
- sh[i+1] == H[i+1] + S[i+1] + SS[i+1]

 

We can use this knowledge to fill in column 0. We need `sh[0] == 0`  because when we want to split an SHA sequence into 2 SH sequences and  multiply them together we might split at the index 0 to give us a left SH sequence of length `0` and a right LP sequence of length `n-1`.

     |  0  |  1  |  2  |  3  | ... | n
------------------------------
H    |  1  |  1  |  2  |  4  |
------------------------------
S    |  0  |  1  |  1  |  2  |
------------------------------
SS   |  0  |  0  |  1  |  1  |
------------------------------
sh   |  1  |  2  |  4  |  7  |
------------------------------
