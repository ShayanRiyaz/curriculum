Now, let's start building our `reverse()` function by creating variables. We can first make a copy to the head node and label it as **curr** and assign the tail node as a copy of the **curr** in order to move through and reverse the entire list. During the reversing process, we will need another variable **temp** with a value `None` that will be used in swapping the nodes around **curr**.

```python
def reverse(self): 
    temp = None
    curr = self.head
    self.tail = curr
```
