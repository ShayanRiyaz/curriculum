Now, let's start building our `reverse()` function by creating variables. We can first make a copy to the head node and label it as `curr` in order to start the process at the beginning of the list. During the reversing process, we will need to establish another variable **temp** with a value `None` that will be used in swapping the nodes around `curr`.

```python
def reverse(self): 
    temp = None
    curr = self.head
```
