Now before we dive into coding the actual reversing process, we need to check for certain cases.

If the list is either empty or only has one node, then the reversing process is not needed/ will not work because there is nothing that can be reversed! So, we need to make sure that check for these cases before running our lists through the reversing process.

```python
def reverse(self): 
    temp = None
    curr = self.head
    self.tail = curr

    # Check for the cases such as
    # empty list and list with only one node 
    if curr is not None: 
    	self.head = temp.prev 
```
