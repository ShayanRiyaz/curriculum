Similar to insertion, there are also multiple ways to delete elements from a doubly linked list, and they are the same as introduced in the previous card. Check out the description and implement these functions in your doubly linked list class:



**Deleting Elements From the Start**

- Define a function called **popFront()** which does not take in any parameter.
- If the list is empty, return.
- Otherwise, delete the head node.

```python
def popFront(self):
  
  	# 1. If the list is not empty
  	if self.head == None:
				return
        
	else:
    	# 2. If there ISN'T only one node
    	if self.head.next != None:
      		self.head = self.head.next
      		self.head.prev = None
            
  		# 3. If there IS only one node
  		else:
        	self.head = None
        	self.tail = None
            
     # Decrement size
	self.size -= 1
```



**Deleting Elements From the End**

- Define a function called **popBack()** which also take in no parameter.
- If the list is empty, return.
- Otherwise, delete the tail node.

```python
def popBack(self):
	# 1. If the list isn't empty
	if self.head == None:
  		return

	else:
  		# 2. If there ISN'T only one node
    	if self.head != None:
    		self.tail = self.tail.prev
    		self.tail.next = None

    	# 3. If there IS only one node
    	else:
     	 	self.head = None
     	 	self.tail = None
	
	# Decrement size
	self.size -= 1
```


**Deleting Elements by Value**

Write a function called **pop()**. In this method, you need to think carefully since several cases have to be handled in order to remove an element by value.

- This function takes in a value as the parameter.
- If the list is empty, return.
- If the targeted node is not in the list, print the message: "Target not found".
- Otherwise, remove the node that contains the element in the list.

```python
def pop(self, target):

	# 1. Check if the list is empty
	if self.head == None:
  		return

		else:
         # 2. Search for target
      	 while curr.data != target:
        		curr = curr.next
            
            if curr == None:
            	print("Target not found.")
                return

    # Decrement size
    self.size -= 1
```
