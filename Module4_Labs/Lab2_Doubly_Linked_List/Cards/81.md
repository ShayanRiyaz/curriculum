Remember that Big O notation describes the behavior of functions as input grows, in this case as the number of elements in the doubly linked lists increases. 

The time complexity O(n) describes the behavior of the access and search functions on a doubly linked list. Here, **n** refers to the size of the input. So the greater the input, in this case the number of elements in the list, the more time these operations will take.

The time complexity O(1) describes the behavior of insertion and deletion functions. This means that it takes constant time, or the same amount of time, no matter the amount of data in a doubly linked list. 

For all of these operations, the average and worst case time complexities are the same, so you don't need to try to achieve a more efficient Big O.

Lastly, O(n) space complexity means that the more elements (n) in the list, the more space the doubly linked list will take up.
