Now that we know how to add nodes to the list, let's learn how to *remove* nodes from the list with our function `popFront()`.

To access from the **head** of the list, we will use `self.head` since it points to the first node in the list. We should also check if the list is empty because if it is, then we can just write `return` since there are no nodes to remove.

```python
def popFront(self):
  
  	# 1. If the list is not empty
  	if self.head == None:
				return
```
