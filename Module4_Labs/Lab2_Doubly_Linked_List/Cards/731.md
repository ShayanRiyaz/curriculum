Now, let's starting coding the actual reversing process!

To reverse the list, we cannot just simply switch `self.head` and `self.tail`. We must reverse the `next` and `prev` pointers as well!

The while loop will iterate through each node and halt when `curr` reaches the very end of the list. If we were at the 2nd node in a list of 5, we would create a `temp` pointer to 1st node, then switch the 2nd node's pointers like so: `curr.prev` to `curr.next` and `curr.next` to `temp`.

The final step in the while loop is interesting. We would think that we would want `curr = curr.next`, but remember that we just swapped the `next` and`prev` pointers! Now `prev` is now pointing in the direction of `next`.

With that, your reverse() function is complete! 

```python
def reverse(self): 
    temp = None
    curr = self.head
    self.tail = curr

    # Check for the cases such as
    # empty list and list with only one node 
    if curr is not None: 
    	self.head = temp.prev 
    
    # Swap next and prev for all nodes of  
    # doubly linked list 
    while curr is not None: 
        temp = curr.prev  
        curr.prev = curr.next
        curr.next = temp 
        curr = curr.prev
```
