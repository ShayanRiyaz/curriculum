# Printing Elements in a Stack

As we know, stacks are a great data structure that we often use in Pythons. We need to be able to create function that returns what elements are inside the stack. This function should under `Class Stack():`
```
## code_snippet

``` python
def get_stack(self):
    return self.items
```
# Returning Stack Information Step 2

## name
```
Calling the function
```

## md_content
```
When we call this function, we should be able to access all the elemts inside the stack. 

To view what elements are inside, you can simply print the stack with this line of code:
```

## code_snippet
``` python
print(stack.get_stack()):
```

# Returning Stack Information Step 3

## name
```
When the Stack is Empty
```

## md_content
```

### When Stack is Empty

It is very important that when the stack has no elements inside it, we need a way to check for that. We can do that by creating another function under your `Class Stack():`:

If the stack has no elements in it, and we call the function, what should be returned is `True`

If the stack does have elements in it, the function will return `False` 
```

## code_snippet
``` python
def is_empty(self):
    return self.items == []
```

```
Peeking at the stack
```

## md_content
```

### Peeking at the Stack

This line of code lets us view the top of the stack. It allows us to view the first item on the stack. 

```

## code_snippet
```python
def peek(self):
	if not self.is_empty():
		return self.items[-1]
```
