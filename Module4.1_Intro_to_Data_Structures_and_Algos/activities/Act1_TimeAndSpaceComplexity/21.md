##### Let's look at one last function: 

```python
keypad = [[1, 2, 3], 
          [4, 5, 6],
          [7, 8, 9],
          [0]] 
def listInList(keypad):
    sum = 0
    for row in keypad:
        for i in row:
            sum += i
    return sum
```

Again, we will be trying to predict what time this function grows in. 

If we divide the function into parts, we get the lines `sum = 0`, `sum += i`, and `return sum` .
`sum = 0` repeats once, so the time for this line to process is constant.

`sum += i` is in a *for loop* so it might be intuitive to think that this line only repeats *n* times. However, this for loop is nested within another for loop, so the total number of iterations would be *n^2*.

Lastly `return sum` repeats once, so this line will be processed in constant time. 

Since our function has a line that repeats itself n^2 times, we predict that this function grows in **quadratic time**.  Looking at the graph, we see our prediction is indeed correct. Quadratic runtime starts growing quite quickly in comparison to a linear runtime. Notice that the equation for a quadratic equation is **a*n^2*+b*n*+c** where a, b and c are constants.



If we graph this out, it will look like the graph below:

Looking at the graph, we see our prediction is indeed correct. Quadratic runtime starts growing quite quickly in comparison to a linear runtime. Something else to note is that the equation for a quadratic equation is **a*n^2*+b*n*+c** where a, b and c are constants.
