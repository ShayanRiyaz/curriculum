### Implementing a queue

When implementing a queue, here are a couple points to remember:

1. The points of entry and exit are different in a Queue.
2. Enqueue is a function of a Queue data structure used to add an element to a Queue
3. Dequeue is a function of a Queue data structure used to remove an element from a Queue
4. The front of a Queue is the element of the Queue that was first enqueued
5. The rear of a Queue is the element of the Queue that was last enqueued 
6. Random access is not allowed - you cannot add or remove an element from the middle.

Keep these facts and definitions in mind as we go through the implementations of a Queue.

We are going to see two different implementations. One is using Lists and another is using the library *deque*. Let’s take a look one by one...

> Remember, Queues operate in FIFO (first in, first out) order

Here we are going to define a class `Queue` using a list and add methods to perform the below operations:

1. Enqueue elements to the beginning of the `Queue` and issue a warning if it's full
2. Dequeue elements from the end of the `Queue` and issue a warning if it’s empty
3. Assess the size of the Queue
4. Print all the elements of the Queue

```python
class Queue:

  #Constructor creates a list
  def __init__(self):
      self.queue = list()

  #Adding elements to queue
  def enqueue(self,data):
      #Checking to avoid duplicate entry (not mandatory)
      if data not in self.queue:
          self.queue.insert(0,data)
          return True
      return False

  #Removing the last element from the queue
  def dequeue(self):
      if len(self.queue)>0:
          return self.queue.pop()
      return ("Queue Empty!")

  #Getting the size of the queue
  def size(self):
      return len(self.queue)

  #printing the elements of the queue
  def printQueue(self):
      return self.queue

myQueue = Queue()
print(myQueue.enqueue(5)) 
print(myQueue.enqueue(6)) 
print(myQueue.enqueue(9)) 
print(myQueue.enqueue(5))
print(myQueue.enqueue(3)) 
print(myQueue.size())     
print(myQueue.dequeue())  
print(myQueue.dequeue())  
print(myQueue.dequeue())  
print(myQueue.dequeue())  
print(myQueue.size())    
print(myQueue.dequeue())  
```

###  custom visual

```
True
True
True
False
True
4
5
6
9
3
0
Queue Empty!
```

Call the method `printQueue()` wherever necessary to ensure that it's working.


**Note:** You will notice that we are not removing elements from the beginning and adding elements at the end. The reason for this is covered in the 'implementation using arrays' section below.
