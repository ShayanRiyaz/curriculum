Understand the important points about queues

When implementing a queue, here are a couple points to remember:

1. The points of entry and exit are different in a queue.
2. Enqueue is a function used to add an element to a queue.
3. Dequeue is a function used to remove an element from a queue.
4. The front of a queue is the element of the queue that was first enqueued.
5. The rear of a queue is the element of the queue that was last enqueued. 
6. Random access is **not** allowed. That is, you cannot add or remove an element from the middle of a queue.

Keep these facts and definitions in mind as we go through the implementations of a queue. One implementation uses lists and another uses the `deque` library. Letâ€™s take a look at each implementation.

List implementation details
```

## md_content

```
We define a class `Queue` using a list and add functions to perform the below operations:

1. Enqueue elements to the beginning of the `Queue` and issue a warning if the `Queue` is full. In this example, we define "full" as when the `Queue` has 5 elements.
2. Deque elements from the end of the `Queue` and issue a warning if the `Queue` is empty.
3. Assess the size of the `Queue`.
4. Print all the elements of the `Queue`.

`printQueue()` can be called wherever necessary to ensure that all the functions are working as intended.
```

## code_snippet

```python
class Queue:
    # Constructor creates a list
    def __init__(self):
       self.queue=[]

    # Adding elements to queue
    def enqueue(self,data):
        if (self.size() < 5):
            self.queue.insert(0,data)
            return True
        return False
            

    # Removing the last element from the queue
    def dequeue(self):
        if self.size() > 0:
            return self.queue.pop()
        return "Queue Empty!"  

    # Getting the size of the queue
    def size(self):
        return len(self.queue)

    # printing the elements of the queue
    def printQueue(self):
        print(self.queue)
        
 
myQueue = Queue() # initialize a queue
print(myQueue.enqueue(5)) # prints True
print(myQueue.enqueue(6)) # prints True
print(myQueue.enqueue(9)) # prints True
print(myQueue.enqueue(5)) # prints True
print(myQueue.enqueue(3)) # prints True
print(myQueue.enqueue(10)) # prints False
myQueue.printQueue() # prints [3, 5, 9, 6, 5]
print(myQueue.size())     # prints 5
print(myQueue.dequeue())  # prints 5
print(myQueue.dequeue())  # prints 6
print(myQueue.dequeue())  # prints 9
myQueue.printQueue() # prints [3, 5]
print(myQueue.dequeue())  # prints 5
print(myQueue.dequeue())  # prints 3
print(myQueue.size())     # prints 0
print(myQueue.dequeue()) # prints "Queue Empty"!
```
