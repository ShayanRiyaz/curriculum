> Note: we'll be using the list implementation of the queue for this example. This means to run the example code, you will also need to include the `Queue` class we coded earlier in the List Implementation section.

We've gone over the implementation of queues, but now let's take a look at a real-life application of them. For this example, let's envision that we have people boarding onto an airplane in Chicago. For the purposes of the example, let's say that there is no assigned seating; rather, common courtesy demands that the first people to board the plane get the first seats (those at the front of the plane). Let's load up our plane with 50 passengers:

```python
passengers = 50 # initialize the number of passengers that will board the plane
boardingPlane = Queue() # initialize the queue

# enqueue all the passengers (passenger 0, 1,..., 49)
for x in range(passengers):
	boardingPlane.enqueue(x)
  
print(boardingPlane.size()) # prints size of 50 (the number of people who have boarded the plane)
```

> Each passenger is represented by an integer. For example, if we have 50 passengers, the passengers are numbered 0, 1, 2,..., 49. The for loop above enqueues passenger 0, then passenger 1, and so on until passenger 49. What do you think `boardingPlane.printQueue()` would result in? Think about it and test it out for yourself!

After all the passengers have boarded, the plane takes off and, later in the day, it lands at the San Francisco International Airport. However, only the first 30 passengers in the front leave because the 20 passengers in the back will stay for a connecting fight. The first 30 passengers corresponds to passengers 0 to 29 for the variable `frontPassengers` for our `boardingPlane`.

```python
frontPassengers = 30 # first 30 passengers who will leave the plane

# dequeue the 30 passengers (passengers 0 to 29) who will be leaving the plane
for x in range(frontPassengers):
	boardingPlane.dequeue()

print(boardingPlane.size()) # result prints a size of 20 (the number of people who are still on the plane)
```
