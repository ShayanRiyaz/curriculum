A queue is a simple data structure whose basic concept can be applied to our daily lives, like when one stands in a line to buy coffee at Starbucks. People enter the line from one end and leave at the other end. The person to arrive first leaves the line first and the person to arrive last leaves the line last. Once all the people are served, no one is left in the line! Similarly, in a queue, the element to "enter" the queue first "leaves" the queue first and the element to "arrive" last "leaves" last.

Now, letâ€™s look at the properties of queues:

1. Queues are open from both ends meaning elements are added from the back and removed from the front
2. The element to be added first is removed first (First In First Out - FIFO)
3. If all the elements are removed, then the queue is empty and if you try to remove elements from an empty queue, a warning or an error message is thrown.
4. If the queue is full and you add more elements to the queue, a warning or error message must be thrown.
