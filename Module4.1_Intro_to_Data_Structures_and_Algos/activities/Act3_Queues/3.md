## Deque Library Implementation

**Step 1: Understand what the `deque` library is and what functions it has**

`deque` is a library which provides ready-made commands such as `append()` and `appendleft()` (**both** used for enqueuing elements) and  `pop()` and `popleft()` (**both** used for dequeuing elements). 

Why are there two functions for enqueuing elements and two functions for dequeuing elements as well?  What advantage does this give us? This allows for us to use the `deque` library to create **double-ended** queues, meaning that insertions and deletions can occur at *either* end of the queue. In other words, we are allowed to add or delete elements from both the left and the right of the queue. See the following details about the different enqueuing and dequeuing functions:

* `append(x)` - enqueues an element `x` to the **right** of the queue.
* `appendleft(x)` - enqueues an element `x` to the **left** of the queue.
* `pop()` - dequeues an element from the **right** of the queue.
* `popleft()` -  dequeues an element from the **left** of the queue.

`remove()` is another useful function in the `dequeue` class. We can use `remove()` to remove a specific element from the queue, even if it is in the middle of the queue!

**Step 2: Understand an example using the `deque` library**

The following code shows each function we have discussed from the `deque` library in action!

```python
# First import the deque library
from collections import deque

# Creating a Queue
queue = deque([1,5,8,9])

# Enqueuing elements to the right of the queue
queue.append(7) # [1,5,8,9,7]
queue.append(0) # [1,5,8,9,7,0]

# Dequeuing elements from the left of the queue
queue.popleft() # [5,8,9,7,0]
queue.popleft() # [8,7,9,0]

# Enqueuing elements to the left of the queue
queue.appendleft(10) # [10,8,9,7,0]
queue.appendleft(2) # [2,10,8,9,7,0]

# Dequeuing elements from the right of the queue
queue.pop() # [2,10,8,9,7]
queue.pop() # [2,10,8,9]

# Removing elements from the queue
queue.remove(8) # [2,10,9]
queue.remove(2) # [10,9]

# Printing the elements of the Queue
print(queue)
```

Try using the `popleft()` or `pop()` functions to empty the queue. Then call `popleft()` or `pop()` after the queue is empty and see what you get. Think about the ways in which you can handle this issue.
