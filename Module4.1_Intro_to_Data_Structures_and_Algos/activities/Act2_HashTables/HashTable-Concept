<!--title={HashTable Concept}-->

A hash table is a data structure that is a common technique used to solve a variety of problems. 
It serves as a key value lookup.
What this means is that the programmer creates "keys" that link directly to a value. 
Later when looking up information, the programmer can simply lookup the "key" associated to the value they would like and we can quickly find the value.

A real life example would be the UC Davis student record system. 
Every student is assigned a Student ID number and when the UC Davis offices look up that ID number, a variety of information about the student appears.
Just by looking up a simple nine-digit number, the system is able to pull up information like a student's name, DOB, address, etc. 
In this example, the key is the ID number and the student information is the value. 

### Hash functions
Hashtables require Hashfunctions that can be used to simplify data. Hash functions take in our Key value, and assign it an index in our HashTable.

The Keys in the image are represented by SS and JD. The Hashfunction converts those keys to Index Values and associates a symbol with it. That symbol is then stored in the Hashtables index value. 

### Collisions 
Something we need to be mindful for is collisions. There are an infinite amount of inputs that we can place into our hashtables, but only a certain number of symbols our HashFunction can generate. 
To fix this, we resort to another concept called **Chaining**.
