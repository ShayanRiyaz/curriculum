# Build on tower of Hanoi example

## Introduction

Hanoi Tower: The Hanoi Tower (also known as Hanoi Tower) problem is an educational toy derived from an ancient legend in India. When Brahma created the world, three diamond pillars were made. On one pillar, 64 gold discs were held in order from the bottom to the top. Brahma ordered Brahmin to reposition the discs from below on another pillar in order of size. And it is stipulated that the disk cannot be enlarged on the small disk, and only one disk can be moved at a time between the three pillars.



## Example

In this example, the number of disks are three. We need to figure out a way to move all the disks to pillor C under the rules. 

Disk 2 moved from A to B
Disk 1 moved from C to B
Disk 3 moved from A to C
Disk 1 moved from B to A
Disk 2 moved from B to C
Disk 1 moved from A to C



We can find a pattern here. When we move the disks for n=3, we conduct the experiment when n=2.

### Pattern

1. Shift 'n-1' disks from 'A' to 'B'.
2. Shift last disk from 'A' to 'C'.
3. Shift 'n-1' disks from 'B' to 'C'.



### Solution

```python
def TowerOfHanoi(n , from_rod, to_rod, aux_rod):
	#n is the number of disks
	# from_rod, to_rod, aux_rod stand for three pillars
    if n == 1: 
        print "Move disk 1 from rod",from_rod,"to rod",to_rod 
        return
    TowerOfHanoi(n-1, from_rod, aux_rod, to_rod) 
    print "Move disk",n,"from rod",from_rod,"to rod",to_rod 
    TowerOfHanoi(n-1, aux_rod, to_rod, from_rod) 
```
