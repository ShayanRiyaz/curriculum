## Typora:

### Downloading Typora:

For those who do not have Typora, download Typora at [typora.io](http://typora.io). Once you click the link and are redirected to the Typora page, click the arrow at the bottom to be redirected to the home page. At the top right, select Download. Select the download that is most compatible with your computer and follow the download instructions.

### Using Typora:

Typora is a mark-down editor that makes it easy for both the editor and the student to navigate through curriculum developing and reading. The basics of Typora consist of **opening files**, **creating new files/cards**, **writing text and code blocks** of varying sizes.

#### Opening files:

Once you open Typora, go to the bottom left of the opened window. The words "Open Folder" should appear and click on it. Open the folder that contains the card activities. If you are making a new activity, you must still open a folder but it should be an empty one.

#### Creating new files/cards:

After opening a folder, a plus should be available to click at the bottom left corner of the window. Click on it to create a new file \(card\). To rename your file, right click on the name of the file.

#### Writing text and code blocks:

**Text:** In the blank space towards the right of the window, begin typing the necessary explanations for your activity.

**Mini Code Block:** To make a small code block, surround your text with this symbol: \( `). This symbol can be found at the top left corner of your keyboard, next to the number 1. It should look like this if formatted correctly:`hello\`

**Code Block:** Type three of these: \( \` \) in a row and then click enter to create the large code block. At the bottom right of the code, you can type in a type of coding language \(i.e. python\) to specify which language you are focusing on.

### **Your task:**

### **Reviewer:**

### **Due Date:**

#### Step 1: Accessing Airtable

Find the task named above in the CS Airtable within the **All tab**. You may change the view to activities \(refer to the Airtable guidelines\). Search for the module that was assigned to you. You can do a quick search by clicking Command-F for mac or ctrl-F for other computers. The activities within the given module are now highlighted. For example, if you search for the task Programming Practice, the four activities that are within that module are then highlighted.

#### Step 2: Downloading the files

Download the file\(s\) in the ZipFile column of each highlighted activity and unzip them. To download them, click on the file. At the bottom right of the screen, there should be a blue rectangle with the word Download. Click on the word download and add the file\(s\) to your computer as you would with downloaded files. \(Refer to the Airtable Guidelines\) We recommend you place the files somewhere where you can easily access the activities. Open the files using Typora. \(Reference the Typora Guidelines\) For example, when you click on the file within the zip curriculum column for the Intro to Command Line activity, a blue button will appear with the word download.

#### Step 2.1: Downloading Typora

#### Step 4: Editing the Cards of the Activity

Refer to the Typora section for guidance on how to use Typora. After each change made to the card, Typora automatically saves the edit.

#### Step 5: Re-uploading the edited files

Once you have completely edited all of the cards, zip the file\(s\) containing the edited cards into one composite file. Name the file with your last name, followed by an underscore and the name of the original file. \(i.e. lastname\_ProgrammingPractice\) Upload the zipped file into their respective ZipFile Curriculum column in tab All on Airtable. Once uploaded, it should be beside the original file that you previously downloaded. Make sure that each file is uploaded into the correct row.

For example, click the plus sign within the ZipFile Curriculum column for the activity Intro to Command Line. Add in your zipped file and it should appear into the column, next to the original activity \(not pictured\).

#### Step 6: Contacting your reviewer

After you have uploaded your files, contact your reviewer \(named above\) through Slack right away. Complete this assignment before the due date which is also written above.

## Accessing the Perfect Lab

Minesweeper is a lab example that perfectly executes all the components of a lab.

How to access the Minesweeper Lab:

Go to the All tab within the CS Airtable. Click Command-F for Macs or ctrl-F for others and search "Minesweeper". The row belonging to the perfect lab will then be highlighted. Download the file in the Zip File Curriculum column that is named Minesweeper PERFECT.zip. Open the file in Typora in order to see the perfect lab.

## Fixing Issues Process:

### Developer:

The reviewer will assign issues to certain developers \(aka you\), asking you to fix the marked issues within the specified cards. To make changes, first create your own branch within the shared Bit Project repository.

### Step 1: Creating a Branch

Go to the Bit Project Github repository that was shared with you. Under the code tab, click on the button of Branch: master. A drop down should appear and allow you to type in the search bar. Type in a new and unique name for a branch, following the format: FirstName\_Name\_of\_Activity. Select create branch: FirstName\_Name\_of\_Activity. Once you create your branch, you will make all of your changes to the files within this branch.

### Step 2: Github Desktop

We recommend that you use Github Desktop. Refer to the Github Desktop Set-Up section for how to download Github. Once your Github Desktop is set up with the Bit Project repository, click Fetch \(or Pull\) Origin at the top of the window. This “fetches” the latest version of the repository. Select your own branch that you previously created. Then open the repository in your external editor of your preference.

### Step 3: Text Editor

In your choice of text editor, select the specific file for the card that requires to be edited. Once you open it, make the necessary changes to it \(refer back to the issues on GitHub\). Save your edits on the text editor. Github Desktop will detect the changes.

### Step 4: Committing and Pushing on Github Desktop

Once you have made the required fixes to the files and saved the file, Github Desktop will allow you to commit to your branch to solidify the changes. Click on the Commit button on the bottom-left corner of Github Desktop. The changes are saved to the branch, but the changes are not registered in Github just yet. In order to do so, we must “push” the branch. There are two ways to do so.

1: Click on the blue button "Push" that appears in the light blue box that states that you have a push.

2: Select Repository near the top left of the screen. From the drop down, select push. This officially brings the saved changes to the Github repository.

### Step 5: Pull Request

Now back to the Github website. Within the code tab, there should be a notification of your recently pushed branches. Select the green button of Compare and Pull request.

Your base should be the master branch while the compare should be your branch. Make sure the name of the request accurately reflects what you are doing.

Follow the following format when naming the pull request

In the comment section, you must mention which issue\(s\) you resolved \(i.e. Close issue \#...\) . On the right of the pull request, change the label to Stage 1: Pre-review as this is the stage you have just completed. Change the assignees to your reviewer, assigning them to look over your work. Then press on the big green button of Create pull request.

Photo comment is not correct. Please put Close issue \#

### Step 5.5: Reviewer Comments

### Step 6: Resolving Reviewer Comments/Issues

_\(Incomplete\)_ Repeat steps 2-5

### Step 6.5: Assign Reviewer to Kevin

Once the reviewer deems the work as satisfactory, the reviewer will assign the work to Kevin to make the final assessment. The request will be labeled as Stage 2.

## Github Desktop Set-Up

Github Desktop is developed specifically for users that are yet to be familiar for the standard git commands. It is designed to make the workflow of Github much simpler.

### Step 1: Downloading Github Desktop

Download Github Desktop at [https://desktop.github.com/](https://desktop.github.com/). Follow the procedure of downloading an application.

### Step 2: Configuring Github

After downloading the application and opening it, you must now connect Github Desktop to the given Bit Project Curriculum Repository.

On the Github website, go to the Bit Project Curriculum repository. Towards the right, click on the green button: Clone or download. The dropdown will provide a link. Copy the link.

Go to the Github Desktop application. At the top left, select File. Then select Clone repository in the drop down. Paste the URL link into the URL text box. Change the local path to an empty file within your computer system.

Click on Clone and the Bit Project repository should now be connected to your Github Desktop.
