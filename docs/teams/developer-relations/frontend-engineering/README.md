# Frontend Engineering

#### Introduction **\(Importance of learning frontend \)**

Static sites are incredibly prevalent among web development as they are useful in terms of performance. Gatsby is renowned for its intuitive design as a static site generator which is why it is the ideal tool to teach Front End Programming. Gatsby offers great functionality with its many plugins and easy incorporation of Graphql. Here at Bit, we believe that Gatsby will be increasingly prevalent in the Front-End development scene and want to host a Bootcamp to share this knowledge with undergraduate Computer Science communities. 

#### Mission \(Teach people how to frontend without worrying about backend \) 

Our Bootcamp will be divided into three segments, each taught over one week. When combined, student’s will have developed an app that is a culmination of a variety of Computer Science skills. Learning to use Gatsby allows for a foothold in app-development, as well as an introduction to a powerful application called the JAM stack. Gatsby is essentially a tool when utilizing the JAM Stack which is why we want to provide the means for students to learn how to use it. As Gatsby becomes increasingly useful in app-development, so does the need to learn its functionality. Here at Bit, that is what we strive to provide.

This topic is designed to give students insight into using Gatsby to develop a static site for real-world sources.
