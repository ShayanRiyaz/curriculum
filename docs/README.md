# Bit Project

## About Us

We make software engineering and computer science education accessible to students from nontraditional learning environments. Using our curriculum, we take students with minimal experience in computer science to a full-fledged software developer with a diverse coding portfolio using our curriculum. We collaborate with leading companies and developers to create interactive, fun technical content that use industry standard technologies and developer tools.

## Our Culture

As an organization that defaults to asynchronous communication, Bit Project relies heavily on textual communication. This can feel unusual or even uncomfortable for those who come from a colocated environment, where in-person meetings and vocalized communiques are the norm. Embracing text communication and learning to use it effectively requires a mental shift. Mastering this should be seen as a long-term project, though there are tips to breaking down barriers and experiencing benefits.

The Bit Project team handbook is the central repository for how we run the company. As part of our value of being transparent all of our culture is open to the world, and we welcome feedback. Please make a pull request to suggest improvements or add clarifications. Please use issues to ask questions.
