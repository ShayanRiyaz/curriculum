<!--title={JSON ME}-->

RESTful API servers are built with JSON. JSON stands for **J**ava**S**cript **O**bject **N**otation and uses key-value pairs. 



In this activity you'll create a server that uses a GET request with express to read a sentence as JSON. You'll then parse the JSON and send back the requester a regular string version of the JSON as a sentence. Have your server listen to port 3000 and GET the `'/json'` route.



Let's start with our import statements:

```js
const express = require('express')
const app = express()
```

Next, we'll define the GET structure of our function. To explain, the following code is executed if the user accesses the `/json` route. 

```js
app.get('/json', function(req, res) { 
	// we'll fill in the code here!
})
```







Respond with:

```js
res.json(object)
```

Everything should match the `/books` resource path.


For reading the file, use the `fs` module, e.g.,

```js
fs.readFile(filename, callback)
```

-----------------------------

## HINTS

While the parsing can be done with `JSON.parse`:

```js
object = JSON.parse(string)
```

No need to install the `fs` module. It's part of the core and the Node.js platform.
