<!--title={Query Strings}-->

This `?results=recent&include_tabs=true` is called a query string. It is used as another way to pass information from the browser to the server. Its like the URL parameter, but slightly different in that you get the data after the question mark. Query string are often used in searches to provide some filters or some option. 

Use app.get('/search', function(){...}) for the route.
As always, we will first start by creating a new file, here called ``query.js``. Then, import the dependencies:

``````javascript
const express = require('express') // the dependency is the express framework itself
``````

Next, we will create the Express app:

```javascript
const app = express()
```

Once we have created the app, we will then define our get/seach functions with a request handler:

```javascript
app.get('/search', function(req, res){/*   */}
```

In Express.js, to extract query string parameters, we can use ``req.query.NAME``. This should be done within the request:

```js
const query = req.query
```

Since we used query in this case, this is the object that will be passed through: 

```js
res.send(query) //Sends the HTTP response
```

Finally, connect the file to a port by using the ``app.listen`` command.

```javascript
app.listen(3000)
```

Once completed, the final code should look like:

```js
const express = require('express')
const app = express()

app.get('/search', function(req, res){
  const query = req.query
  res.send(query)
})

app.listen(3000)
```

Lets go to the terminal and run it:

```
nodemon query.js
```

Once it is up on the port, head over to the browser and type in:

```
http://localhost:3000/search?name=Eddy&Age=25
```

The result should look like:
