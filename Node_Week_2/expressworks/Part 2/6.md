<!--title={Querying in Express}-->

Items can be passed into URLs in other forms than what we did previously, like `/route/:value`. Another way to pass items into the URL is in a **key** and **value** pair. The format to do so would be `/route?key1=value1`. If we wanted to get multiple keys and pairs, you could add an `&`in the URL. Here's an example format: 

```
/route?key1=value1&key2=value2
```

Potentially we can add as many key and value pairs as we want. In this exercise, we'll write a route that extracts data from the query string in the GET `/search` URL form `?results=recent&include_tabs=true` and then outputs it back to the user in JSON format.

We'll start with our usual import statements:

```js
const express = require('express')
const app = express()
```



We'll be using a normal GET - conversely from the previous way we received a value, our GET method relies on a `?` being present: 

```js
app.get('/search', function(req, res) { 
	// we'll fill in the code here!
})
```

Next, we have to check if an item was passed into the URL. The `/search` route can be called with or without items in the parameter, so our function will have to use an **if** statement. If there is items in the parameter, they will be contained in `req.query`. So we can use an if statement to check if that exists: 

```js
app.get('/search', function(req, res) { 
	// If there are items in the URL
  if (req.query) { 
  	res.send(req.query)
  // No items in the URL
  } else { 
  	console.log('do nothing')
  }
})
```

In the above, if there are items in the URL, we send it back to the user, and if not we just log to the user that we're doing nothing. 

Great job, the final step is to have your app listen to the port on  `process.argv[2]`.
