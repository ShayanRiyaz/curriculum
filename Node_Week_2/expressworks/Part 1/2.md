<!--title={Static Assets in Express}-->

In this exercise, we'll be serving static assets like HTML files!
There are many ways to do it, but we want you to apply static middleware to serve the file `index.html`.

Please don't use ANY routes like `app.get`, ONLY use static routes. Using a static route means that the file is ready to send directly to the user, as opposed to being generated by a route defined!

Have your solution listen on the port number supplied by `process.argv[2]`.

The `index.html` file is provided and usable via the path supplied by
`process.argv[3]`. However, you can use your own file with this content (beware of whitespace):

```html
<html>
  <head>
    <title>expressworks</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="/main.css"/>
  </head>
  <body>
    <p>I am red!</p>
  </body>
</html>
```

The first thing we'll need to do in our file is redefine our app, and import a new module:

```js
const express = require('express')
const app = express()

const path = require('path')
app.use(express.static('public'))
```

In the above statement we're creating our app, and telling our app to use the static pages stored in `'public'`. 



Now, let's make our code use either `process.argv[3]`, OR the absolute path to the `public` folder. The path is constructed with `path.join()`:

```js
app.use(express.static(process.argv[3] || path.join(__dirname, 'public')))
```

Great job! If you still need help, the solution is here: http://bit.ly/1jW1sBf. Try using the above code before you watch the video to check your work.
