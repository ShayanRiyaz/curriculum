<!--title={Hello World}--> 

"Hello World" is the text most students output as their first exercise. We're going to do that!



Our goal is to create an Express.js app that outputs "Hello World!" when somebody goes to `/home`. The port number will be provided to you by {appname} as the first argument of the application, i.e. `process.argv[2]`.



The first step in our process is to install the Express module if you haven't done so already. 

```
$ npm install express --save
```

Great! Once we've installed that, we'll need to import the module into our file. Express uses the keyword `require` for import notation. We define our `app` using the express import call `express()`. 

```js
const express = require('express')
const app = express()
```



Since all we've done is import express, we need some code that will listen to our app when the web browser goes to `/home`. The `app.get()` express function will receive the request by taking in a function with a request `res` and a response `res`. 

```js
app.get('/home', function(req, res) { })
```

Now, let's have our function respond by saying 'Hello World.'

```js
app.get('/home', function(req, res) {
	res.send('Hello World!')
})
app.listen(3000)
```

`app.listen(3000)` means that our function will listen to the port 3000 on our web browser. So when we enter **localhost:3000/home** into our web browser, our function will respond.

But, we want our function to listen to a port provided, so our final code should be:

```js
app.get('/home', function(req, res) {
	res.send('Hello World!')
})
app.listen(3000)
```

Run `$ killall node`  before verifying exercises (in your terminal on Mac OS X) to end any previous processes.

For Windows, use "taskkill /IM node.exe" in Command Prompt.



Great Job!
