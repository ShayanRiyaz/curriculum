<!--title={Good Old Form}-->

This exercise will be specifically talking how to process the traditional (non-AJAX) web form.

Our goal is to write a route (`'/form'`) that processes HTML form input
(`<form><input name="str"/></form>`) and responds with the value of `str` backwards.

To start lets first include the `express` module in out program and create an instance:

```js
var express = require('express')
var app = express()
```

Express.js uses **middleware** to provide extra functionality to your web server. Middleware lies between an operating system and the applications running on it and enables communication and data management for distributed applications, providing a large variety of functionality such as logging, serving static files, and error handling.

Simply put, a middleware is a function invoked by Express.js before your own request handler.

In this program we are going to use the middleware `urlencoded()`  from the `body-parser` module. To do this first let's import the  `body-parser` module just like we did for the `express` module, lets just put them together for the sake of visuals:

```js
var express = require('express')
var bodyParser = require('body-parser')
var app = express()
```

How can we access the middleware now that we imported the module? We call the `use()` function and pass the desired middleware as a parameter. Note that we do not have to process complex queries (inputs) so we can parse with the querystring library built into express.  

```js
var express = require('express')
var bodyParser = require('body-parser')
var app = express()

app.use(bodyParser.urlencoded({extended: false}))
```

Now that we have our middleware added, the next step is to handle POST requests. POST requests are like GET requests in the way  that it requests that a web server accepts data,  but, instead of appending the variables to the URL string like with GET, POST sends data in the from of request message where the data is included in the body of the request. 

We can make a POST request simply with the `post()` method. The general form of a post request should look something like ` app.post(url,requestHandler,[reqHandler2,...])

Our program now looks like this:

```js
var express = require('express')
var bodyParser = require('body-parser')
var app = express()

app.use(bodyParser.urlencoded({extended: false}))

app.post('/form',fucntion(req, res){
         
         })
```

We are almost done! now we just have to send the backwardsinput string. We do this with the `send()` method where we place what we want to send back as a parameter. What do we need to do reverse the string? We can first split our input string character by character, reverse them then rejoin them together. We could do this in many ways but one way we can do it simply is through premade functions and do it in one line:

```js
req.body.str.split('').reverse().join('')
```

now we just return it with `send()` and our code should look something like this:

```js
var express = require('express')
var bodyParser = require('body-parser')
var app = express()

app.use(bodyParser.urlencoded({extended: false}))

app.post('/form',fucntion(req, res){
  res.send(req.body.str.split('').reverse().join(''))
})
```

Lastly, we just have to start the Express.js serve with `listen()` where the port number(where the server is started) is passed as a parameter. 

Our final code should look something like this:

```js
var express = require('express')
var bodyParser = require('body-parser')
var app = express()

app.use(bodyParser.urlencoded({extended: false}))

app.post('/form',fucntion(req, res){
  res.send(req.body.str.split('').reverse().join(''))
})

app.listen(process.argv[2])
```



Our final code now looks something like this :

```js
var express = require('express')
var bodyParser = require('body-parser')
var app = express()

app.use(bodyParser.urlencoded({extended: false}))

app.post('/form',fucntion(req, res){
  res.send(req.body.str.split('').reverse().join(''))
})

app.listen(process.argv[2])
```

If you run your code and It does not work I probably means that you have not downloaded the `body-parser` module so lets do that right now in terminal

You may need to do the following command in your terminal before using the `body-parser` module:

```sh
$ npm install body-parser
```

Congratulations! You finished the activity!
