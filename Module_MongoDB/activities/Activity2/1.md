# Accessing Driver API

Now that you have MongoDB, your database GUI viewer, and Node.js installed, you will now move on to accessing the API reference information to connect the interaction between MongoDB and Node.js.

To first start off, go onto MongoDB's official website, the same site that you used to download the MongoDB application. Under the "Docs" header on the main page, navigate into the "Drivers" link. When going to that link, you will notice that there are over a dozen of native drivers for different programming languages. In our case, we are looking specifically for Node.js. 

Find the line for the documentation for Node.js and click on the "API" link corresponding for this language. That will take you to a different page, where you will click on the "API" link on the most recent released driver in the table on the right of the site. 

That link will take you to all the API references for MongoDB and Node.js, which will come in handy in activities and practice.

Here what your Driver API reference sheet should look like:
