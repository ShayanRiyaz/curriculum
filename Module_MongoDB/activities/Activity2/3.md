#Connecting Documents

First off, we will explore all the CRUD operations that are available through MongoDB. We will need to use these operations to manage our data successfully. 

To start, import the module that you just installed into your Javascript file.

```js
const mongodb = require('mongodb');
const MongoClient = mongodb.MongoClient;
```

MongoClient will give us access to the CRUD operations to connect to the database.

Next, define the connection URL in the database. To do this, we will use two variables: connectionURL, which contains the IP address of 127001 and the default port of 27017, and databaseName. For the databaseName, since it is flexible in its name, we can just call it 'task-manager'.

```js
const connectionURL = 'mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017';
const databaseName = 'task-manager';
```

Now, we will use MongoClient to connect the server by using the "connect" keyword.  

This will take in arguments of the connection URL, an object, and a callback function to set up the connection. The connection URL is the same as you made previously and the object will provide a single option called "useNewUrlParser". The last argument, the callback function, will get called to check if the connection to the database was successful. If it was successful, the function will prompt "Connected correctly". However, if there is an error, an error prompt "Unable to connect to database" will prompt. 

```js
MongoClient.connect(connectionURL, {useNewUrlParser: true}, (error, client) => {
	if (error){
		console.log('Unable to connect to database')
	}
} )
```
