#Inserting Documents

Now we will insert document information into our connect function from the previous activity.

First, remove the success prompt and replace it with the insertion code. In MongoDB, there is no table to store the database information. Instead all information is stored in a collection.

Moving along, before inserting a document, we need to figure out which collection we are trying to insert into. In our case today, we will insert documents into a user collection.

To do so, use the collection function with the variable of the collection you are trying to manipulate, which is the "user" collection, followed by the insertOne function. The insertOne function will expect an object as its first argument and that object should contain all the data you are trying to insert. In that function, insert your name and your age.

```js
const db = client.db(databaseName)

db.collection('users').insertOne({
	name = 'John Doe',
	age = 30
})
```

The information is now inserted into the user collection!
