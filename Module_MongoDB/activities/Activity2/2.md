# Installing MongoDB driver for Node.js

Before coding, we also need to download the MongoDB driver for Node.js, meaning Node.js should also already be installed. To do so, go on npmjs.com and search for the mongodb package. On the right hand side of the page, there is an install instruction that you can use to install this package with your Node.js. You can also use this site to read more about the basic instructions on getting started and the documentation that you openned up previously.

Here is the intstallation code circled in yellow.

To install, open a new terminal page with your current bash terminal still running. In the new terminal, type this line and you will have a new terminal specifically for mongoDB, which will be used to insert documents into the database.
