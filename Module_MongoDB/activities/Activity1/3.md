  - We will use MongoDB Community Server, which is the free version of MongoDB

  - Choose Version, OS, and Package as follow:

    **For Mac**

    + Version: choose the current release version
    + OS: macOS x64
    + Package: TGZ

    **For Linux**

    - Version: choose the current release version
- OS: choose the appropriate distribution you are running on
    
    - Package: there are many options as package for Linux; however, you want to choose TGZ for it to work properly



- Then click Download

- **<u>Step 4</u>**: Open and extract the downloaded file

  Now we need to create a place for our data to be stored. By default, data directory is expected to be created at a hard drive and in there, MongoDB also expects a database directory. It is much simple to create the  data directory inside the user folder. 

- **<u>Step 5</u>**: In the Users folder under your username (for example, the path is `/Users/JimBoy/`, create new directory named **mongodb-data** (so we have `/Users/JimBoy/mongodb-data`). This folder will store the data for your database. Now, for your downloaded folder, make sure it is called **mongodb** and also place it within your Users directory (so we have `/Users/JimBoy/mongodb`).



- <u>**Step 6**</u>: Open a Terminal and run the mongodb executable
  - Use `--dbpath` to provide path to the mongodb-data that we just created
  - For example: `/Users/JimBoy/mongodb/bin/mongod.exe --dbpath=/Users/JimBoy/mongodb-data`

- Then hit enter. Now the server is running and it's waiting for connections to the database.

- The terminal should hang there and not ask you to re-enter another command if the database is running.

  **<u>Note:</u>** We want to leave this command running while we are working with the database.
