<h1>Data Validation</h1>
In this activity we will be exploring data validation. 

Now what does data validation mean? It simply means that we ensure our data follows certain rules, for example the user's age must be greater than or equal to 18.

One example of this is to set up some of our fields as required. Say we have a user model, such as the one from the previous activity, with a field **name**.

```js
name: {
        type: String,
        required: true
    }
```

Now if we create a user without a name, we get an error for name. If we had a similar field such as age, notice that we wouldn't get an error for the age if we haven't set required to true. Thus name is compulsory but the age is optional.

Now, lets explore age a little more. We need our age to be positive so let's throw an error if the age is less than zero. We do this as,

```js
age: {
        type: Number,
        validate(value){
            if (value<0){
                throw new Error('Age must be positive')
            }
        }
    }
```



To validate complex things like emails or phone numbers, it's better to use a premade library such as the npm-validator. We install it by using `npm i validator` in the terminal. Now let's add a email field and validate it using our newly installed library.

Remember to declare `const validator=require('validator')` at the top of your code. Now  we can use it as follows.

```js
email: {
        type: String,
        required: true,
        validate(value) {
            if (!validator.isEmail(value)){
                throw new Error('Invalid email')
            }
        }
    },
```

Now name, age, and email all have ways of being validated!
