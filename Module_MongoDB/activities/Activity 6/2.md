<h1>Data Sanitization</h1>
Another important topic is **Data sanitization**. Let's say we need to alter our data before saving it. For example, we may need to remove white spaces around the inputted user's name. We use data sanitization to make our data more consistent. 

We start by trimming the name. We use  `trim: true` to do so.

Now let's say we always want the email to all be lowercase, we do so by setting `lowercase: true` to convert it into lowercase.

Let's add another field called password inside our user model. We'll set it's minimum length to 7 and trim it. Also, let's add another validator to throw an error if the password contains the string "password". We do so as follows.

```js
password: {
        type: String,
        required: true,
        minlength: 7,
        trim: true,
        validate(value) {
            if (value.toLowerCase().includes('password')) {
                throw new Error('Password cannot contain "password"')
            }
        }
    },
```

Next let's use the Task model from the previous activity and modify our description field and make it required. Lets also make completed optional and set it's default value to `false`.

```js
const Task = mongoose.model('Task', {
    description: {
        type: String,
        required: true,
        trim: true
    },
    completed: {
        type: Boolean,
        default: false
    }
})
```

Working with Mongoose we can customize our models to fit our needs, making it really easy to add validation and sanitization. These are two essential topics when it comes to accepting valid input from the user.
