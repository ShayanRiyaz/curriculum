<!--title={Refactor Static Event Pages to Dynamic}-->

Similarly to the Events page, we are now going to refactor the specific Event pages like `turkey-trot` to be dynamic as well. This way, we don't have to manually change the HTML when the database changes. 

We have our static pages for two events: `turkey-trot-event.html` and `coastal-cleanup-event.html`. These will be turned into Dynamic pages that reflect the values of the event database. To do this, we will...

1. Use a GET request and render the page with the specific event's information. For example, if we clicked on Turkey Trot on the Event's page, we would go to `/events/turkey-trot` and see the Turkey Trot event page with the values in the database.
2. Create two `hbs` files named `turkey-trot.hbs` and `coastal-cleanup.hbs` and copy the respective HTML into the files. Then refactor the code with the specific values rendered in the page through the GET request.
