 <!--title={Querying Events}-->

Use form to send the  `GET` Request!! Wrapped a form around  `<input>` and `<button>` in `events.hbs` !  `GET` request will be send the request to the server once we hit the `<button>`. The `input`s will be the variables in the query, being sent over to the API!

Then, once we get to the server, we can use `find` to filter out the target record from our database. 

Afterwards, how do we reflect the changes back to the html? We can accomplish this by re-render the events page, this time, with new `events` passed in to `events.hbs`.
