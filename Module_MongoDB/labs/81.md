<!--title={Refactor Static Event Pages to Dynamic}-->

Now we are refactoring the specific event pages like Turkey Trot. Like we did with the events page, to make these pages dynamic, we will be using Handlerbars as well.

To start, you will want to create a Handlebar file `.hbs` in the `views` folder called `turkey-trot.hbs`. This is where we you will be able to render all of the events given to you by the GET method. This will have the exact same contents as `event.html` for now.

In the `routers` folder, `event.js`  create a method that reads a specific event name. You can achieve this by using the GET method on all events using `findOne()` something like this:

```javascript
router.get('/events/:eventName', async (req, res) => {
	const event = await Event.findOne(...) // TODO
})
```

Make sure to use the `params` function of the request since the only unique piece of information we get is the `eventName` from the request.

After you have gotten the list of events in the database, you should render the `events.hbs` file with the `event` object that was found. You can use the `hbs` syntax to display the values on the page like so:

```handlebars
<span>{{event.date}}</span>
```
