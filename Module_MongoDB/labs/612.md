Now that we have a POST method routed to `/events`, we can now create the new event given the data that was given in the request through `req.body` in the file, *events.js* in the *models* folder.

To implement the POST request for the created event:

1. Create a POST request that routes to `/events`.

```javascript
router.post('/events', async (req, res) =>{
	....
})
```

2. Inside the async function, create a variable to store the contents of the form.

```javascript
    const event = new Event(req.body)
```

3. Use a `try` statement to see if you can insert the document into the database asynchronously. `await` waits for the `save()` function to returns a promise. If successful, state the success status and redirect to the events page (`/events`). This is the page that gets handled by our previous router using GET.

```javascript
    try { 
    	await event.save()
    	res.status(201).redirect('/events')
```

4. If unsuccessful, send the error status and error message.	

```javascript
    } catch(e) {
        res.status(400).send(e)
    }
```
