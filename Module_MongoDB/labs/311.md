<!--title={Adding the Create New Event Page}-->

The resulting HTML code should have the standard HTML header and link to the CSS file.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="sign-up-form.css">
  </head>
```

Next, we will make the container that will eventually have within it all of the html elements:

```html
<div class="container">
      <h1>Create New Event</h1>
```

Next, we will create one of the 6 inputs required for this forms:

```html
		<label for="event-name"><b>Event Name</b></label>
        <input type="text" placeholder="Enter the Event Name" name="eventName" required>
```

We can use a ``label`` to outline the title of our input. Our ``input`` for *Event name* has two attributes:  ``type`` and ``placeholder``.  `Type` specifies the type of element to display. For example, the event name is type `text`, but the date of the event is type `date`.  `placeholder` specifies a hint that is displayed in the input field before the user enters a value. The field is ``required``. Be sure to give the input a ``name`` as well, so we can later on refer to the data in this field from JavaScript. Repeat this process for the next 5 items of information (Event Coordinator, Date, Event Start Time, Event Location, Number of Attendants at the Event. Make sure to match each inputs with its corresponding types! (e.g. text, date, time, number)

Finally, add the buttons. The cancel button will take you back to the events page, with a `href` to *Events.html*. We will leave the submit button alone for now.

```html
<div class="continue">
    <a href="Events.html"><button type="button" class="cancel-button">Cancel</button>
    <button type="submit" class="signup-button">Create New Event</button>
    </div>
</div>
```
