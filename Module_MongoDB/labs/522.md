We will use the asynchronous method in order to get ALL events from the database. After this is done, we can render the page with an object, `events` that is a list of all of the event objects in the database.

Now back to the `hbs` file, we can iterate through each event using `{{#each events}}` :

```handlebars
<ul class="event-ul">
  {{#each events}} {{!-- iterates through each event --}}
    <li>
      <a href={{this.href}}>  {{!-- uses event's href --}}
        <div class="event-content">
          <img class="event-imgs" src="https://via.placeholder.com/150" alt="Coastal Cleanup">
            <div class="event-info">
              <h4 class="event-title">{{this.eventName}}</h4> 
            <div class="event-info-1">
              <span>{{this.date}}</span>
              <span>| {{this.time}}</span>
            </div>
            <div class="event-info-2">
            <span>{{this.location}}</span>
            </div>
          </div>
        </div>
      </a>
    </li>
  {{/each}}  {{!-- end of loop --}}
</ul>
```

Since we are iterating through a <u>list</u> of event objects, we can depend on our database to have all of the information we need to populate the page. If we have 4 events in the database, we will have 4 events showing up on this page, and each event will have values specified by the database like `eventName` and `location`. We can use `this` in order to reference each `event` that's being called in each iteration. 

This page is now dynamic since it does not need any manual changes to a <u>static</u> page if there were changes to the database. We can just depend on the `hbs` file to iterate through each event and do it all for us.
