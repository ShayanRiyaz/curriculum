<!--title={Refactor Static Event Pages to Dynamic}-->

Create two new `hbs` file in the `views` directory called `turkey-trot.hbs` and `coastal-cleanup.hbs` and copy the HTML from the respective HTML files into the `hbs` files.

We will be implementing a similar GET request as the first one, excpet this time we are searching for a specific event. To implement the GET request for the specific event, Turkey Trot, we will do the following:

1. Create a GET request that looks for a specific event name.

```javascript
router.get('/events/:eventName', async (req, res) => {
```

2. Create a variable to store the <u>event name</u> and <u>event path</u> (for validation).

```javascript
	var name = req.params.eventName
	var eventPath = "/events/" + req.params.eventName
```

3. Use a `try` statement to see if you can find an event with the same <u>event path</u>. If there is, render the event which will be the `.hbs` file with that specific name like `turkey-trot.hbs`.

```javascript
	try {
		const event = await Event.findOne({href: eventPath})
		res.render(name, {
```

4. Render the `.hbs` file with information like event name, coordinator and so on.

```javascript
			eventName: event.eventName,
			coordinator: event.coordinator,
			month: monthNames[Number(event.date.slice(5, 7)) - 1].split("").join(" ").toUpperCase(),
			day: event.date.slice(8),
			time: event.time,
			location: event.location,
			description: event.description,
			attendeeCount: event.attendeeCount
		})
```

5. Use a catch block to catch the error if there is no file found with the same path.

```javascript
	} catch(e) {
		res.status(500).send(e)
	}
})
```

This will handle all requests that specify an event name.

Then in the `hbs` file, we can use these values to populate where our static information would have been.

```handlebars
<img class = "header-image" src="turkey_trot.jpg" alt="Marathon runners">
	<h1 class = "header-text"> {{eventName}} </h1>
    <div class="date-box">
      <h2 class = "month">{{month}}</h2>
      <h2 class = "day"> {{day}} </h2>
      <h2 class = "time"> Starts at {{time}}</h2>        
    </div>

		<div class="description">
      <p>{{description}}</p>

      <h3 class = "info-header"> More Info: </h3>
      <p> {{description}}</p>
    </div>
```
