<!--title={Create New Event Functionality}-->

To create a new event, we must first modify the static HTML page `create-event.html`. The inputs will be wrapped in a form with an action to `/events` and method as `POST`. This way, once the form is submitted, it will use a POST request and send all of the information in the inputs to the router.

In the `routers` folder, `event.js`  create a route that handles saving a new event. You can achieve this by using a POST request.

```javascript
router.post('/events', async (req, res) =>{
		// TODO
})
```

The information from the form will come in through `req.body` so make sure to use it. After you have the event information, save it to the database or if unsuccessful, send a status error with the error message.
