<!--title={Refactor Event Page to Be Dynamic}-->

With our current <u>static</u> Event page, if an event was added to the database, we would have to manually create another list item in the HTML and put in all of the data by hand. To avoid the tedious work we can refactor the Event page to show the events that are in the database by using Handlbars and the GET request. 

1. In the `routers` folder, use `event.js` and implement a `GET` request on all of the events in the database. Then render the Handlebars file with the events. This way, we will reflect what's in our database, into our dynamic web page.

2. Create a file in `views` called `turkey-trot.hbs`. The contents of `turkey-trot.hbs` should be identical to `turkey-trot-event.html` except the tedious part, which is displaying each event in the database. To use Handlebars, make sure you configure the settings and the views paths before you implement them to your code. 

To use `hbs` files, we must first install the module. Then configure its the path to the directory that holds the `hbs` files, `views`.

Hint: You will need to look up how to do for loops in `.hbs` files.
