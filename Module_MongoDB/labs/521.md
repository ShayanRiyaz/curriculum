<!--title={Dynamic Browsing Page Retrieving Events}-->

Create one new `hbs` file in the `views` directory called `events.hbs` and copy all of `events.html` into the file.

To implement the GET request to display all events in the database, use the following:

1. Create a GET request that looks for a specific event name.

```javascript
router.get('/events', async (req, res) => {
```

2. Use a `try` statement to see if you can find all of the events. If successful, render the `'events'` (short for `'events.hbs'`) file with the `events` variable. This variable has a list of all event objects in the database.

```javascript
	try { 
		const events = await Event.find({})
		res.render('events', {
			events: events
    })
```

3. If unsuccessful, send the error status and error message.	

```javascript
	} catch (e) { 
		res.status(500).send()
	}
})
```
