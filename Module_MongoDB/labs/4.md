<!--title={Event Database Pt. I}-->

Next, we are going to create the database to store the event info.

A file called `events.js` in the `models` folder under the ``src`` folder will show how we design our database model for the events. Each event should have the following items:
* Event Name
* coordinator 
* date
* month
* day
* time
* location
* description
* attendee count
* a reference to the event itself

The `index.js` file will run our server. You will not need this now but for testing purposes, add this snippet of code:

```javascript
// Auto parses JSON
app.use(express.json())

// Register routers with server
app.use(eventRouter)
app.use(appRouter)
```

We will be running our website through `index.js` and it will be using the routers in the `routers` folder. This is called modularization since we are making routers into modules that we end up using for the website. The routers will end up handling different routes and methods but we'll get into that later.
