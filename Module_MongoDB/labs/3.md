<!--title={Create New Event Form}-->

Create a "Create New Event Form". This form will take input about the event and add it the database. First, make the HTML and CSS files for this page. We need the inputs on the following data:

- Event Name
- Event Coordinator
- Date
- Event Start Time
- Event Location
- Number of Attendants at the Event

It should also come with a submit button at the end, which will be crucial when we want to add all of the input data into a database. In case the user wants to discard the new event, we will also add a cancel button that will redirect back to the login page.
