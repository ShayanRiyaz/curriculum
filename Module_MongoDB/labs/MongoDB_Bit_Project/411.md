<!--title={Event Database}-->

Each value in the database should have rules that dictate how it is going to be stored. We specify these rules so that there is continuity between data. Once you have added all of the information of the event into the model and the respective types the code should look like this.

```javascript
const mongoose = require('mongoose')

const Event = mongoose.model('Event', {
    eventName: {
        type: String,
        required: true,
        trim: true,
        maxlength: 30
    },
    coordinator: {
        type: String,
        required: true,
        trim: true,
    },
    date: {
        type: String,
        required: true,
        trim: true
    },
    month: {
        type: String,
        trim: true
    },
    day: {
        type: String,
        trim: true
    },
    time: {
        type: String,
        required: true,
        trim: true
    },
    location: {
        type: String,
        required: true,
        trim: true,
        maxlength: 50
    },
    description: {
        type: String,
        required: true,
        trim: true
    },
    attendeeCount: {
        type: Number,
        default: 0
    }
})

module.exports = Event
```

At the end of the file, export the model to be used in the routers.
