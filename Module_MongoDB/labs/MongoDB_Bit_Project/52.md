In the `routers` folder, `event.js`  create a method that reads all events. You can achieve this by using the GET method on all events using `find()` something like this:

```javascript
router.get('/events', async(req, res) => {
  // Find ALL events by specifying an empty object
	const events = await Event.find({})
})
```

After you have gotten the list of events in the database, you should render the `events.hbs` file with  `events`. You can then use `hbs` file to render event information, for example, display the event date like so:

```handlebars
<span>{{event.date}}</span>
```

Hint: Find a way to display all of the events' information given the format that they're in now. You will need to look up *how to iterate through items* in `hbs` files in order to display all events with their specific values.
