<!--title={Configuring Views Path}-->

To use `hbs` files, first install and import `hbs` and `path` into `index.js`. The `path` module will allow us to easily find and create String paths. 

First, create variables for the paths and find the paths for the wanted directory like so:

```javascript
// Path
const viewsPath = path.join(__dirname, 'templates/views')
```

Then, use the variables and set the views to use `hbs` files

```javascript
// Configure views
app.set('view engine', 'hbs')
app.set('views', viewsPath)
```

This will allow us to use `hbs` files and also configures the path for the server to find the files.
