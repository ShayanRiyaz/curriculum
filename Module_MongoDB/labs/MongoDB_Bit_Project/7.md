 <!--title={Querying Events}-->

Since we have a search bar, let's enable searching for an event by name. Modify the  `/events` GET method so that the request can take in an event name of the following format:

```node
/events?eventName=Title
```

If the request has an `eventName` , the events page should return the documents that match the name. If it does not , the events page should return all the documents as before!
