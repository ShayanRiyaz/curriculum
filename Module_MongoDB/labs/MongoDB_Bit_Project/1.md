<!--title={Starter Code Preview}-->

The starter code you have been given contains 2 folders: `public` and `src`. 
The `public` folder contains all of the frontend material you will be using in order to interact with the databases like the **Events** and **Login** pages. It will be your job to completely build the HTML/CSS for those pages in the next cards. 
The `src` folder will lead to these folders that will have specific functions:

- `db` - creates a connection with the database using `mongoose.js`
- `models` - contains all of the database models
- `routers ` - contains the REST APIs as well has handles dynamic routing
- `templates/views` - contains the Handlebars files that will be rendered dynamically
- `index.js` -  hosts the server
