<!--title={"Add Event" Functionality}-->

Let's add functionality to the "Add Event" form that we made a few cards back!

To add an event to the database, we can store all of the information on the form through a POST request in order to save the events to the database. To do this, you will want to create a new instance of an `Event` and save the information in the forms. Remember the action that you specified for the `<form>` since that will be the route of the request. The body of the request will contain all of the information in JSON thanks to `app.use(express.json())` in `index.js`.

After adding an event, the website should **redirect** back to the Events page, `/events`.
