In `events.hbs`, wrap a `<form>` around  `<input>` and `<button>`. Let the `action` be the route of the request, `/event`. Let the method be `GET`, because we are getting information from the server.

```html
<div class="search">
            <form id="searchForm" action="/event" method="GET">
                <input type="text" name="eventName" class="searchTerm" placeholder = "Search Events">
                <button class="searchButton">Q</button>
            </form>
</div>
```

The `name` attribute of  `<input>` ensure that the user inputs will be encoded in the variable, `eventName`, in the request. 

This is the equivalent of `/events?eventName=...`. 

Therefore, when the user input is `Dinner`,  when submit, the request being sent is `/events?eventName=Dinner`.  When the user input is ` Marathon`, the  request will be `/events?eventName=Marathon`.
