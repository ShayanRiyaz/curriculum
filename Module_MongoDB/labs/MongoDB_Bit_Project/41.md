<!--title={Event Database}-->

To create the events database, we will need to use mongoose's Model module to have a model for the database. This is the time to design and create the database however you see fit, but remember, there is required information and optional information you can add to the database.

You'll first need to add the mongoose module at the top:

```javascript
const mongoose = require('mongoose')
```

Then, create the event model by using ``mongoose.model``:

```javascript
const Event = mongoose.model('Event', { ... } )
```

Then, place all the required information of the event and the type of each piece of information within the brackets. The first piece of info is done below:

```javascript
eventName: {
        type: ...
        required: ...
        trim: ...
        maxlength: ...
    },
```

`type` specifies the type of the value. `required` is a Boolean that states whether the value is required as an input or not. ` trim` will trim any trailing or leading white spaces of the value if it's a String. `maxLength` will set a max length of characters for a String. Follow this format for all of the information you desire.

Remember to export the module for the server to use!
