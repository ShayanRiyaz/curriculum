<!--title={Basic HTML Framework}-->

We’ll need only a text input box, a button, and a script tag to create our URL shortener.

First create an HTML file called `index.html`, as there is only a need for those two elements (a text input box and a button).

So let’s start adding our three main elements:

```html
<html> 
	<body> 
		<input type=”url” id=”urlinput”> 
		<button onclick=”shorturl()”>Shorten The URL</button> 
		<script src=”main.js”></script> 
	</body>
</html>
```

The first element in our HTML file is `input` where we will type/paste our long URL. We will give it an id name of `urlinput` so it would be easy to access in the JavaScript.

The next element is a `button`. When we click this button, our long URL will be shortened due to its `onclick` function. Inside the `shorturl()` function there will be commands necessary to shorten the URL.

At the end we have a `script` called `main.js` where all our main JavaScript code will be. The above-mentioned `shorturl()` function will be also there.

So, for now, our HTML part is complete.
