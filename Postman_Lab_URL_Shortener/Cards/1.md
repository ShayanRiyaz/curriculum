<!--title={Getting Everything Set Up}-->

In this lab, you will be developing a fully functional URL Shortener. It will have a UI, backend, and a database. It should be able to take in a lengthy URL and shorten it to something more manageable and visually appealing. You've probably used services like this, bit.ly for instance. Now, you will be making your own version.

This application will primarily utilize Node.js and MongoDB. As such,  the first step is making sure you properly set up your working directory. Initialize a Node.js project in your directory (leave everything as default for now), and install the following dependencies:

- Express - the standard web application framework for Node.
- Mongoose - the interface between your Node.js app and the MongoDB database which will act as a middle man of sorts.
- EJS - This will be the templating language that you will be using. It will allow you to generate HTML markup using JavaScript.
- Nodemon - This will ensure that your resulting webpage will be updated immediately whenever you make changes to the code. It is a dev dependency so make sure to install with the appropriate flag.
- MongoDB Server - Ann additional driver for Node to connect to the MongoDB database.

The end goal is to create something that looks like this:
