<!--title={Linking Short URLs with Full URLs}-->

You're almost done! There's one last problem however. You'll notice that nothing happens when you click the shortened URL. In fact, it gives you an error. That's because we haven't actually linked this URL to the long one. You'll be doing that now.

Create another route in `server.js`  that does the following:

- Whenever you try and click on the shortened URL, you see something like this in the address bar - `localhost:5000/h4141J1`. Create the route such that it gets all the information after the first `/` in this address (the short URL itself) and save it in a parameter called `shortUrl`.
- Searches for the corresponding row of the database that matches this `shortUrl` and save it as a variable.
- Sends a 404 error if the original long URL entered was invalid. (What would this mean for the short URL)?
- Updates the amount of clicks corresponding to the short URL.
- Redirects the user to the full URL corresponding to the `shortUrl`.

Don't forget to to make the function asynchronous!
