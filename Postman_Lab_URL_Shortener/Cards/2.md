<!--title={Basic HTML Framework}-->

To get started with the shortener, we will need an actual UI to able to interact with the program. This doesn't need to be overly fancy. A simple webpage with a text input box and a button will do just fine. Create a file called `index.html` that will set this up. It has 3 requirements:

- It need to be able to accepts URLs as input.
- The button, when clicked, should call a function named `shorturl()` that will be defined in our main script file. Give the button a name like "Shorten the URL".
- Our main script will be called `main.js`. Link this to the HTML file.
