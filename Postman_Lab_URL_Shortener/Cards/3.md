<!--title={Storing our Endpoint}-->

Now it's time to start developing the Javascript file. The first step requires an **endpoint** that will allow us to store information about the URL. As previously mentioned, we will be using **jsonstore.io**.

Go to jsonstore.io, and get the endpoint that is provided for you. Next, create a file called `main.js` and store this endpoint as a variable.
