<!--title={Fleshing out Index.ejs}-->

Now it's time to actually flesh out and implement `index.ejs`. This file will create the form for a user to enter their long URL and get back the short URL, but will also host a list of all the short URLs that your application has already created.

First, fill out `index.ejs` with boilerplate HTML code.

Then, fill the body of the HTML code with the following:

- A header. Call it "URL Shrinker" or something of the sort.
- A form with a blank action (for now), where the method will be a POST method.
- An input that accepts URLs called `fullURL` that is linked to a label simply called `URL`.
- A submit button that simply displays the text "Shrink".
- A table which in turn has the following characteristics:
  - Three headers or columns. One for the Full URL, Short URL, and one for Clicks, which will keep track of how many times the generated Short URLS have been clicked.
  - A placeholder value for each column in the first row of the table. You can set these values to whatever you want, but the value for the Full URL needs to be a valid webpage that can be clicked.
