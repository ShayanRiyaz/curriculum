<!--title={Getting the Shortened URL}-->

The code to actually obtain our shortened URL is as follows:

```javascript
var hashh = window.location.hash.substr(1)

if (window.location.hash != "") {
    $.getJSON(endpoint + "/" + hashh, function (data) {
        data = data["result"];

        if (data != null) {
            window.location.href = data;
        }

    });
}
```

 The above code will be executed whenever we put the short URL in the address bar (eg. https://shorturl.com/#abcd ).

First, we store the hash value from the URL in the `hashh` variable.

> *Example: if our short URL is https://shorted.com/#abcd , the value of the hash will be **#abcd.***

Then we check if the hash location is empty or not. If it’s not empty we send a get request to the address, `endpoint` + `hashh`.

> *Example:* `https://www.jsonstore.io/8ba4fd855086288421f770482e372ccb5a05d906269a34da5884f39eed0418a1/abcd`

And as usual, if everything is okay we will get the long URL from the data which is JSON array data, and from that we extract the result with `data["result"]`.

> *The value of data will be similar to this `{"result":longurl,"ok":true}` , where the long URL is the URL you shortened.*
