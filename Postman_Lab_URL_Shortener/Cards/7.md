<!--title={Connecting our Server with our Scheme}-->

Now, you need to actually connect the server with the schema that you built in `shortUrl.js`. First things first, import the file in `server.js`.

Then, fill out the method for the actual POST request. Create an instance of the `shortUrl` schema and initialize it with the information about the full URLs. You can get this information from the body of the form.

In order for this to properly work, you will need to tell Express that you are **using** URL parameters.

Additionally, the `app.post` method is an **asynchronous** function in theory. This means that it runs in the background, and that we want to wait until it finishes executing before moving on with the rest of the program. Make the appropriate modifications to the function so that this is the case in actuality. 

Finally, make sure that the user gets redirected back to the homepage created by our `index` within the `post` method after the instance is created.
