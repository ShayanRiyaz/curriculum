<!--title={The Main Function I}-->

Now we get to the nitty gritty of our program! We've already created a function that will verify the validity of the original URL, and create a new hash for us. Now, we actually need to communicate with our endpoint to store the long URL with a link to the new shortened URL. 

Create a function called `send_request()` to do this. The function will take the long url as input.
