<!--title={Getting URLs from the Database.}-->

If you try running the shortener as it is now, you'll notice that everything executes just fine but we don't see any updates to the URL table.

To get the URLs to show up in the table, modify the `get` method to find all the URLs from the `ShortUrl` schema and render them in the homepage. Addionally, make this method asynchronous.

To get this to fully work, you will also need to make changes to your `index.ejs` file. Specifcally, modify it so that it loops through each row in our `shortUrl` database, and produces the respective values for each URL,   namely `full`, `short`, and `clicks`.
