<!--title={Creating the POST request}-->

Now it's time to actually implement the POST request for our application and create the basis for generating and displaying the short URL.

First, modify `index.ejs` to use an endpoint called `\shortUrls` as part of its POST request.

Then, create that endpoint in `server.js`. Here, you will be setting up the connection between the application and the database. As a result, use `mongoose` to formally set up this connection. Call the local database you will be linking to as `UrlShortener`. Additionally, the connection should be set up such that there are **no deprecation warnings**.
