<!--title={Creating the Database Model}-->

As it is now, your database is practically blank and formless. You need to establish some sort of framework, or **model** as to what it should actually look like and what information it should contain.

Create a folder called `models` and in turn create a file called `shortUrl.js`.

In this file, create a **schema ** for the database. The schema should contain all of the information relating to our table that we created previously. More formally, it should have the following characteristics:

- A **required** property called `full` which represents the full URL in our table.
- A **required** property called `short` which represents the shortened URL in or table. HERE is where you will actually generate short URLs. Do so by utilizing the **shortid** library (make sure to install it first), and its **generate()** function to set a default for this cell in the database.
- A **required** property called `clicks` which represent the number of times a URL has been clicked in our table. Give it a default value of 0.

Don't forget to export the schema after you're done!
