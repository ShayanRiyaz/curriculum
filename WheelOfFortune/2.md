Now let's set up what the user initially sees: the rules, the category, the hidden phrase and the amount of money needed per correct letter and vowel.

Example Output:

```
Guess one letter at a time. If you want to buy a vowel, you must have at least $500, otherwise, you cannot buy a vowel. If you think you know the word or phrase, type 'guess' to guess the word or phrase. You will earn each letter at a set amount and vowels will not cost anything.
Category: color
_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ 
$1750 per correct letter
$500 per vowel

```
