Check if the guess is a vowel. The player needs to have more than $500 in order to buy a vowel.<img src="https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcTYKwDCYgKefuAXYqgJ_nr3p-GvKF81uQnWl5n1Adq8A0StPM6Amw" align="right">

If they have more than $500, remove the letter from the alphabet.

Iterate through the hidden phrase, each time comparing the guess with a character in the correct phrase.

At every spot where, there is a matching vowel, reduce the amount of money the player has and insert the letter into the blank.

If the player does not have enough money, they cannot buy a vowel.

Print the money the player has and the hidden phrase and check if there are any blanks.
