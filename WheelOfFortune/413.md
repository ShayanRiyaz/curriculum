If the amount correct is equal to the length of the hidden phrase, 

```python
if correct == len(guess):
```

Iterate through the length of `guess`, each time checking if the characters in guess and word are the same.

```python
	for letter in range(len(guess)):
		if guess[letter] == word[letter]:
```

If they are the same, check if the `Word` at that index is a letter.

```python
			if not Word[letter].isalpha():
```

If it is not a letter, insert the letter into the hidden phrase.

```python
				Word[letter] = guess[letter]
```

Also check if it was a letter and if it's a vowel. Correct letters earn a set amount of money, while vowels don't earn any money.

```python
				if guess[letter] not in vowels and guess[letter].isalpha():
					total += amount
```
