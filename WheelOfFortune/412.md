Check if their guess is correct.

One way is to compare `guess` with the hidden phrase, `word`, letter by letter and count how many are the same. 

Create a variable to count how many letters are the same.

```python
correct = 0
```

Iterate through the length of `guess`, each time checking if the characters in guess and word are the same.

```python
for letter in range(len(guess)):
	if guess[letter] == word[letter]:
		correct += 1
	else:
		break
```
