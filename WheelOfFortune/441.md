If everything else is false, that means that the guess is in the alphabet and has not been guessed.

```python
else:
```

First remove the letter from the alphabet.

```python
	alphabet.remove(guess)
```

Then iterate through the hidden phrase `Word`, each time comparing the `guess` with a character in `word`, which contains the correct phrase.

```python
	for char in range(len(Word)):
		if word[char] == guess:
```

At every spot where, there is a matching letter, insert the letter into `Word` and increase the player's money according by the amount that a correct letter is worth.

```python
			Word[char] = guess
			total += amount
```

Print the money the player has and the hidden phrase.

```python
	print('You have: $' + str(total))
    printWord(Word)
```

Check if there are any blanks.

```python
	if '_' not in Word:
		break
```
