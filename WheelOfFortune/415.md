Then check if there are still blanks in the hidden phrase.

```python
if '_' not in Word:
```

If there are no blanks, print the word, the amount of money the player has, and then break.

```python
	printWord(Word)
	print('You have: $' + str(total))
	break
```

If there are blanks, iterate through the length of `Word`, checking if the character in word is the same as `guess`.

```python
else:
	for char in range(len(Word)):
		if word[char] == guess:
```

If it is the same, replace the character in `Word`.

```python
			Word[char] = guess
```

Print the amount of money the player has and the word.

```python
print('$' + str(total))
printWord(Word)
```

Also check if there are any blanks.

```python
if '_' not in Word:
	break
```
