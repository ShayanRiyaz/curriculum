DFS and BFS are 2 sides of the same coin. What I mean by this is that they have the same goal of traversing a graph, but the way they traverse a graph is different. However, despite the difference in their ways, the time complexity for both of them are exactly the same: O(V + E) for an adjaceny list and O(V^2) for an adjacency matrix. 

To explain this, we will have to delve into the code of DFS. 

```Python
def DFSUtil(self, v, visited): 
	visited[v] = True
	print(v, end = ' ')
	for i in self.graph[v]: 
		if visited[i] == False: 
			self.DFSUtil(i, visited) 
        
  def DFS(self, v): 
	visited = [False] * (len(self.graph)) 
	self.DFSUtil(v, visited)   
```

###What is the time complexity?

Just like in our BFS algorithm, the for loop runs in O(n) time, where n is supposed to be the number of edges of the graph. However, unlike in our BFS algorithm, there is no while loop to iterate over each and every vertex inside the graph. Therefore, where does the V come from in the O(V + E) stated above?

Well, as it turns out, the while loop is actually hidden in the code above.  Instead of looping through the vertices using a while loop, what the code does is that it recurses. What that means is that it calls itself n times for each and every vertex inside the graph we are traversing, thus making the while loop hidden. This can be seen in the last line of the `DFSUtil` function:

```python
if visited[i] == False: 
	self.DFSUtil(i, visited)
```

Therefore, the recursion occurs in O(n) time, where n is the number of vertices in the graph. Thus, when we combine the time complexities for recursion and the for loop, we again get O(V + E). 

### Adjacency List vs Adjacency Matrix

We will get the same time complexity we got for BFS for the adjacency list and the adjacency matrix implementation of DFS. And the reason for that is the same reason given for BFS. If you were to use an adjacency matrix, then you will have to iterate V^2 times, but in an adjacency list, you will only have to do it V + E times. Thus, adjacency list = O(V + E) and adjacency matrix is O(V^2).
