<!--title={Matchsticks to Square: Completed Code}-->

Now, this is what your completed code of `makesquare()`should look like!

```python
def makesquare(nums):
	L = len(nums)					  # Number of matchsticks we have
	perimeter = sum(nums)			   # Perimeter of the square (if one can be formed)
	possible_side =  perimeter // 4		# Possible length of the sides of the square
    
    # If there are no matchsticks, a square cannot be formed
    if not nums:
        return False

    # If the perimeter cannot be equally split by 4, a square cannot be formed
    if possible_side * 4 != perimeter:
        return False

    # Reverse sort the matchsticks to consider the biggest one first for efficiency
    nums.sort(reverse=True)

    # This array represents the 4 sides and their current lengths
    sums = [0 for _ in range(4)]

	# Our recursive dfs function
	def dfs(index):

		# If we reach the end of matchsticks array, we check if the square was formed or not
		if index == L:
			# If 3 equal sides were formed, 4th will be the same as these three
			return sums[0] == sums[1] == sums[2] == possible_side

		# The current matchstick can belong to any of the 4 sides
		for i in range(4):
			# If this matchstick can fit in the remaining space of the current side
			if sums[i] + nums[index] <= possible_side:
				# Perform ecursion
				sums[i] += nums[index]
				if dfs(index + 1):
					return True
				# Revert the effects of recursion since we no longer need it
				sums[i] -= nums[index]
		return False        
	return dfs(0)
