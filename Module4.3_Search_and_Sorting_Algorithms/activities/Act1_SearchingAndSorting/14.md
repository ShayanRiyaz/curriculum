<!--title={Matchsticks to Square: Completing DFS Implementation}-->

After establishing the base cases for our nested `dfs()` algorithm, let's continue onto the rest of the code:

For the matchstick we have selected with the current index, we have four different options, meaning it can be a part of any of the sides of the square, and we will test out these four options by performing recursion.

```python
		for i in range(4):
```

Now, starting with the first option, we will first check if the matchstick can fit into the remaining space on the current side. If it does, then we shall proceed by performing recursion.

```python
			if sums[i] + nums[index] <= possible_side:
				sums[i] += nums[index]
```

Then, if there is more recursion that needs to be done, we will return `True` and continue.

```python
                    if dfs(index + 1):
                        return True
```
If not, we will revert the effect of recursion since we no longer need them anymore.

```python
                    sums[i] -= nums[index]
```

We are done with coding the recursion process, but if the matchstick on the current index did not even fulfill the first condition (if the matchstick could fit into the remaining space on the current side), then the function will skip to the end and return `False`.

```python
            return False        
```
Don't forget to return your result in the end!

```python
	return dfs(0)
```
