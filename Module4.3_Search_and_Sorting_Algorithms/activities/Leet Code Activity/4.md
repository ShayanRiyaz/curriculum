Next up is the while loop. It is here that our solution will iterate over each and every element inside the linked list once:

```python
while cur and cur.next:
```

The above basically means that while cur and cur.next exists, then the algorithm will continue to loop. Inside the while loop is the following:

```python
	val = cur.next.val
  if cur.val < val:
       cur = cur.next
       continue
  if p.next.val > val:
        p = dummy
  while p.next.val < val:
        p = p.next
  new = cur.next
  cur.next = new.next
  new.next = p.next
  p.next = new
```

We will now begin to break it into pieces to explain what each and every part of the code does. 

```python
val = cur.next.val
if cur.val < val:
   cur = cur.next
   continue
```

The first line here basically assigns the current val to be the next val. Then, the first if statement compares the current val with the next val. If the current val is less than the next val, then that part of the list is already sorted so we can move on by making cur go onto the next node via `cur=cur.next` and have the while loop continue iterating via `continue`.

```python
if p.next.val > val:
        p = dummy
```

The second if statement checks if there is an element which is smaller than previous. If there is, you make p be dummy in order to find a proper postion to insert the smaller element.
