**BFS Code Walkthrough**

Here is graphical representation of what an example graph looks like in "theory.":

After going through the BFS code, try to run the algorithm on this graph (starting at node 2) to test your understanding. We present the code to test running BFS on this graph at the end of the section.

Here is a BFS algorithm in Python, broken down line-by-line:

```python
from collections import defaultdict
```

The first line here gets something called a "defaultdict" from the collections library. A "defaultdict" is basically a dictionary data structure but instead of giving you an error when you try to access a key that doesn't exist: its makes it for you with a default value you pass in. <sup>Â **1**</sup>

```python
class Graph: 

	def __init__(self): 		
		self.graph = defaultdict(list)
```

Here we initialize the graph class. What you need to know is simple: the __init__ function is called when a new graph object is made. When it is called, it just attaches defaultdict to the object. 

```python
	def addEdge(self,u,v): 
		self.graph[u].append(v)         
```

So, if I wanted to create a graph with 3 nodes (nodes 1,2,3) which are connected by one edge from 1 to 2 and 1 to 3, it would look like this:

<img src="https://i.ibb.co/fnByb2Y/Connection-in-2-md-3.png" style="zoom:50%;" />

What the next piece of code basically means is: we create a function `addEdge` that takes the starting node (`u`) and final node (`v`) and connects them via an edge. In terms of code, we store the `u` as the key in the graph's defaultdict and store all its connecting nodes in a list we can access through said key.

```python
	def BFS(self, s):       
```

Now let's get in to the real meat of this code: the function `BFS.` `s` in the function parameters is the node we decided to start our BFS algorithm on. 

On to the next line! 

```python
visited = [False] * (len(self.graph)) 
```

All this line does is set all of our nodes to "not visited" [`visited` keeps track of the vertices that have been visited]. It just does it in fancy way. For example, [False,False,False] is equivalent to [False] * 3, where 3 is the number of edges in the graph.

You're doing great, let's move ahead!

```python
		queue = [] 
		queue.append(s) 
		visited[s] = True
```

Now here we initialize the queue and add our starting node into it (which is `s`). Finally we set our node `s` to visited!

```python
		while queue:  
			s = queue.pop(0) 
			print (s, end = " ") 
			
```

Next, we look through our queue and pop out the oldest node we added to it (the first node in the queue).  We stop looking when our queue runs out of nodes! After we pop out a node from the queue, we print it to the screen as we are done with this node.

The final stretch, I know you can do this! 

```python
			for i in self.graph[s]: 
				if visited[i] == False: 
					queue.append(i) 
					visited[i] = True
```

Here we loop though all the adjacent nodes (relative to `s`) and add them to the queue if we haven't visited them. During our tree traversal if we find we have no more adjacent nodes (relative to the node we are currently on), we just go back to the front of the queue. This takes us to the next node we are to deal with. 

We keep doing the above until we go though the entire graph and every node is visited.  Congrats ðŸŽ‰! That is the end of the code!

However, before you leave, lets just use an illustrated example on how the code works:

<img src="https://i.ibb.co/qRTzqnC/Connection-in-2-md-5.png" style="height:100%;width:100%;" />





In the first step, we add our start node (`1`) to the queue, mark it as visited, and pop that node. We note that this node has `2` and `3` as adjacent nodes and we add both of these nodes to the queue. We then pop the first node from the queue (`2`), mark it as visited, and see that it has no unvisited neighbors to add to the queue. Then we pop the second (and last) node from the queue (`3`), mark it as visited, and see that no unvisited nodes are to be added to the queue. Thus, the queue is now empty and all the nodes have been visited. 

This code is the code we use to test our BFS algorithm.  We initialize this graph with by writing :

```python
g = Graph() 
```

Furthermore, we add edges between nodes by the addEdge() function. The first argument is the node that we start the edge from and the second parameter is the node where we end the edge connection.

```python
g.addEdge(0, 1) 
g.addEdge(0, 2) 
g.addEdge(1, 2) 
g.addEdge(2, 0) 
g.addEdge(2, 3) 
g.addEdge(3, 3) 
```

The graph we have made here is the same as that show in the visual at the beginning of the section.

Finally, we initialize the BFS algorithm by specifying which node we start the algorithm from.

```python
print ("Following is Breadth First Traversal"
				" (starting from vertex 2)") 
g.BFS(2) 
```

Run this code and see the output to test your understanding of BFS.
