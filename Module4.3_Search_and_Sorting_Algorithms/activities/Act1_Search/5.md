**Depth First Search** (**DFS**) is another algorithm that traverses and/or searches a tree. DFS starts at the root node (selecting some arbitrary node as the root node in the case of a graph) and explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking. This approach to traversing the graph differs from BFS because BFS explores *every* neighbor of a given node fully before moving to the next node. DFS, on the other hand, continually selects a single neighbor to visit, then selects a neighbor of that neighbor, and so on until it reaches a node which has no unvisited neighbors. DFS then backtracks to a node that has an unvisited neighbor and continues this process until all nodes are visited. Refer to the diagram below and pay special attention to the order DFS visits the nodes of the graph. Try and compare this to the BFS algorithm shown earlier.

As in the example given above, DFS algorithm traverses from S (the start node) to A (the first unvisited neighbor of S) to D (the first unvisited neighbor of A) to G (unvisited neighbor of D) to E (unvisited neighbor of E) to B (unvisited neighbor of B) first, then (after backtracking to G) visits F and lastly to C. It employs the following rules.

- **Rule 1** − Visit the adjacent unvisited vertex. Mark it as visited. Display it. Push it in a stack.
- **Rule 2** − If no adjacent vertex is found, pop up a vertex from the stack. (It will pop up all the vertices from the stack, which do not have adjacent vertices.)
- **Rule 3** − Repeat Rule 1 and Rule 2 until the stack is empty.

Instead of using a queue, like BFS does, DFS uses a stack data structure. Remember that a stack is a **L**ast **I**n, **F**irst **O**ut (LIFO) data structure. We use a stack so that we can backtrack the path we took to reach our current node when the current node has no unvisited neighbors (refer to step-by-step breakdown below). As we go through understanding DFS, ponder about why this algorithm uses a stack and how its use of a stack as opposed to a queue plays a role in making its execution different than BFS.

Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the use of a stack in BFS.
