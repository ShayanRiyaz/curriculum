**Binary Search** is a searching algorithm used on a sorted array. It compares the target value to the middle element of the array (i.e. is the target greater, smaller, or equal to the middle element). If they are not equal, the half in which the target element cannot lie is eliminated and the search continues on the remaining half, again taking the middle element to compare to the target value, and repeating this until the target value is found. If the search ends with the remaining half being empty, the target is not in the array.

##### How Binary Search Works (Pictoral)?

As stated earlier, for a binary search to work, it is mandatory for the target array to be sorted. As we go through the algorithm, keep this in mind and think about why such is neccessary.

We shall learn the process of binary search with a pictorial example. The following is our sorted array and let us assume that we need to search the location of value 44 using binary search.

First, we shall determine half of the array by using this formula

```
mid = low + (high - low) / 2
```

In this case, low = `0` as we wish to search the an array starting at index 0 (the element with value 10). `high` = 9 as the array we are searching has its last element at index 9 (the element with value 60). When using this formula, one is able to find the index of the middle element of the array (`mid`).

Thus, the formula in our specific case is

```
mid = 0 + (9 - 0) / 2 = 4
```

But, wait, isn't 9 / 2 = 4.5? When doing binary search, we truncate the decimal point when computing our mid index as we do integer division. More on this when we get to explaining the code.

So, 4 is the index of the middle of the array.

Now we compare the value stored at location 4, with the value being searched for, i.e. 44. We find that the value at location 4 is 32, which is not a match to our target value. As our target value is greater than 32 and we have a sorted array, we know that the target value must be in the upper portion of the array (between index 5 and 9).

Hence, we calculate the mid again. This time it is 5.

![binary_search_5](https://i.ibb.co/fN4GPQY/Array-Base-3.png)

We compare the value stored at location 5 with our target value. We find that it is a match.

We conclude that the target value 44 is stored at location 5.

In essence, binary search halves the searchable items and thus reduces the count of comparisons to be made to very less numbers.

**How Binary Search Works (Code)?**

Let's run through a coded example. We start with the following sorted list (`arr`) and our target value is 10.

```python
arr = [ 2, 3, 4, 10, 40 ] 
x = 10
```

We make the call to the aptly named `binarySearch` function and initialize it with the necessary parameters. 

Paramater `arr` represents the array that we will be searching. The second parameter serves as the index of the start of the subset of the array we will be searching. Likewise, the third parameter represents the end of the subset we will be searching. In this case, we pass `0` as the second parameter and `len(arr)-1` as the third parameter as we wish to search the entire list (from index `0` to the last index) for our target element. The last parameter to the function is our target element, which in this case is `x`.

```python
# Function call 
result = binarySearch(arr, 0, len(arr)-1, x) 
```

Now lets take a look at the binary search implementation in Python:

We start with the function declaration and we send in the start index (`l`), end index (`r`) and the target value (`x`) into the function.

```python
def binarySearch (arr, l, r, x): 
```

Next, we write the code that finds the middle of our current list and makes sure we don't mess around with lists smaller than 1 (i.e empty arrays/lists). Lists are smaller than one when `r >= l` as the length of a list can be represented by its right index minus its left index (`r-l`). If `r >= `l, `r-l <= 0.`

```python
	if r >= l: 
		mid = l + (r - l)/2
```

Now, we have three cases to check:

* In the first case, we check if the middle of our list contains the target value

```python
 		if arr[mid] == x: 
			return mid 
```

For example let's say the target (`x`) in the following list is 44. We had earlier calculated `mid = 0 + (8 - 0) / 2 = 4` Our middle index (which is 4) gives us is exactly that! That is `arr[mid] == x` and we can return our `mid` index, 4, as the index containing the target element.

* If the middle element is not equal to the target element, we check if the target value is in the upper part of the list. Since the list is sorted, we know that the element is in the upper part of the list only if `arr[mid] < x`. So we cut it up accordingly and try running the function again with the newly adjusted (upper) list! This is done by changing our left (start) index to `mid + 1` (the start of the upper list) and retaining the end index as what it previously was, `r`. `x`, our target value, is also passed in to indicate that we are still searching for the same target value.

```python
		elif arr[mid] < x: 
			return binarySearch(arr, mid+1, r, x) 

```

For example let's say the target in the following list is 49. It is located in the upper part of the sorted list, so we cut our list to be from the middle on to the end accordingly and re-run binary search again!

* If the target value is not the middle element and is also not in the upper part of the list, then the target value is in the lower part of the list. So we cut it up accordingly and try running the function again with the newly adjusted (lower) list! This is done by changing our right (end) index to `mid - 1` (the end of the lower list) and retaining the start index as what it previously was, `l. `x, our target value, is also passed in to indicate that we are still searching for the same target value.

```python
      else: 
			return binarySearch(arr, l, mid - 1, x) 
```

For example let's say the target in the following list is 18. It is located in the lower part of the sorted list, so we cut the list to from the start up to (but just before) the middle accordingly!

If we find that we have "eaten" up the entire list and still haven't found the target value (as the more we cut up the list to find the target value: the smaller it gets). We tell the user that the value doesn't exist! -1 is a good choice to return as an indication that the value doesn't exist as it is an invalid array index.

```python
	else: 
		return -1
```

Just as a sanity check, here is how the list we talked about earlier (with the target 10) would run:

<img src="https://i.ibb.co/g9THTdv/Array-Base.png" style="zoom:50%;" />

After we call our function, we finally display the results of our search!

```python
if result != -1: 
	print "Element is present at index % d" % result 
else: 
	print "Element is not present in array"
```

As stated earlier, if the result returned by `binarySearch` is -1, then we know that we have not found the element (-1 is not a valid array index). Otherwise, we have found the element!
