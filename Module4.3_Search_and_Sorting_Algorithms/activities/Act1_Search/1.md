**Introduction to Search Algorithms:** Let's say you have a huge collection of comic books and one day you feel like reading a specific comic book out of your collection. You have to *search* through your collection to find the comic book you want. 

If your bookshelves is sorted alphabetically, you can just look at the place where similarly named comics are. Or you can go one by one, looking through each comic on the shelf. As you can see your searching method depends on what you are exactly searching for and where this item is housed. These factors also help you choose certain sorting/searching algorithms in the "real world".

Here we have illustrated the core idea behind search algorithms: we have a collection of data (with both shared and unique traits) and we want to find a unique element or group of elements in this collection. 

Here will we go over a couple of types of search algorithms, namely: Breadth-first Search, Depth-first Search, and Binary search.
