Now that we have our linked list definition, we can start on the actual solution. The first part of the code is :

```python
def insertionSortList(self, head):
    p = dummy = ListNode(0)
    cur = dummy.next = head
```

In this part of the code, `insertionSortList(self, head)` Is the name of our function that will sort the linked list and solve our problem. It is also here that p is initialized along with dummy to have a val of 0 and be the root of the linked list. In our solution, p's role will be to be the pointer for where cur will insert after.  And our dummy variable is the linked list that we will return as a sorted linked list. 

In the second line of the code, cur and dummy.next are initialized to be the head of the linked list. In our solution, cur will be used to compare with other elements and ensure that everything is sorted through said comparisons. These pointers are necessary to keep track of where things are as well as to determine if the linked list is sorted and if not, where it is not sorted.
