**Worst Case**

The worst case time complexity for the solution we made is O(n^2). This is because the worst case scenario is when the sorted linked list is reversed. Then that would mean that we would have to manually sort **all** of the elements in the linked list one by one. Therfore, we would have to use the first while loop and the second while loop inside the first one to their full potential, resulting in O(n^2).



**Average and Best Case**

The best case scenario would be when the linked list is already sorted. In thay case, our time complexity would be O(n) because regardless of whether or not the linked list is sorted, our solution will still have to go through all the elements in the linked list once to check if it is sorted or not. Both the best case and worst case scenarios are highly unlikely, and the most likely scenario to happen is mixture of both where some parts of the linked list is sorted while the other parts are not. Therefore, we will still have to use the second while loop in our solution, resulting in O(n^2) as our average time complexity.
