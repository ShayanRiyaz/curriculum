The second while loop is there to iterate through p:

```python
while p.next.val < val:
        p = p.next
```

Basically, while the next value of p is less than the next value of cur, then the current p will change to become the next p. As a result, p will only stop at the element which is smaller than val.

```python
  new = cur.next
  cur.next = new.next
  new.next = p.next
  p.next = new
```

These 4 lines of code are here for the swapping and insertion part of the algorithm.The first line is basically the temporary variable that allows us to swap values. The second line is there to concatenate the elements in the sorted sequence. The third line is new.next being assigned to p.next. What this means is that it is swapping the values of cur.next.next with p.next. The fourth line is there to swap the next value of p with the next current vallue of cur. 

Finally, we return dummy.next to return the sorted list. 

Therefore, the solution should look like this:

```python
def insertionSortList(self, head):
    p = dummy = ListNode(0)
    cur = dummy.next = head
    while cur and cur.next:
    	val = cur.next.val
      if cur.val < val:
           cur = cur.next
           continue
      if p.next.val > val:
            p = dummy
      while p.next.val < val:
            p = p.next
      new = cur.next
      cur.next = new.next
      new.next = p.next
      p.next = new
return dummy.next
```
