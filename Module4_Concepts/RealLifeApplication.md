### GPS (Global Positioning System)

To find the shorted path from point A (green) to point B (red), we can use Dijkstra's algorithm
Suppose that any geographical map as a graph. Now locations in the map are our **nodes** in algorithm.
And road between loacations are **edges.** **Weights** of the edges are the distance between those two locations here.
