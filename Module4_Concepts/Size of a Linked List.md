<!--title={Size of a Linked List}-->

The size method is very simple. It counts the nodes until it canâ€™t find any more, and returns how many nodes it found. The method starts at the head node and travels down the line of nodes, adding 1 to the count each time. When the tail is reached, it adds 1, and then the tracking variable `current` is set to None, since the value after the tail is None. At this point the while loop is exited and the final count is returned. 

```python
def size(self):
    current = self.head
    count = 0
    while current:
        count += 1
        current = current.get_next()
    return count
```

The time complexity of size is O(n) because each time the method is called it will always visit every node in the list but only interact with them once, meaning n * 1 operations, n being the number of nodes.
