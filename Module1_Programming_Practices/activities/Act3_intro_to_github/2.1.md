# Add a New File to the Repo

Since you have a git repository now, you can add new files to the repo by using any text editor or running a `touch` command.

Type `touch test.txt` to add a file named *test.txt* in the folder *gitfolder* containing a git repo. Git will notice that changes have been made inside the repo. However, git won't officially keep track of the file unless you commit[^2] the change to git.

Use the `git status` command to see which files git is aware of. You will expect to see the following message:

This message basically means that git has noticed that you created a new file called *test.txt*. Unless you use the `git add` command, git will not do anything about it.

[^1]: [A **repository**, or “repo” for short, is a digital directory or storage space where you can access your project, its files, and all the versions of its files that Git saves.]
[^2]: [A **commit** is a record of what files you have changed since the last time you made a commit. Essentially, you make changes to your repo and then tell git to put those files into a commit.]
