Enter the `git add test.txt` command in your git bash to add the file *test.txt* to the staging environment. When you first added *test.txt* to the repo, git notices that a file has changed but won't do anything with it until you add the files to the staging environment via a commit. We will discuss how to add to commit soon.

Try the command `git status` again and you will see that git has added the file to the staging environment ("Changes to be committed").

```
$ git status
On branch master

No commits yet

Changes to be committed:
	(use "git rm --cached <file>..." to unstage)
		new file: test.txt
```

Before git add, test.txt is in “untracked” category which is in the local working directory, afterwards, test.txt  is in the staging area.

And we're about to add the file to a commit.

# Create a Commit

A commit is a revision. It is an individual change in a file. It will be useful since every time the file is saved after creating a commit, a unique ID is created so revisions are recorded.

After git commit, test.txt is know in the local repository.

Run the command `git commit -m "My first commit"` and you will see the following message:

```
$ git commit -m test.txt
[master(root-commit)*a sequence of numbers*] My
first commit
1 file changed, 0 insertions(+), 0 deletions(-)
create mode *a sequence of numbers* test.txt
```

The message at the end of the commit, in this case is "The first commit", should be something related to what your commit contains - perhaps you added a new feature or you fix a bug or a typo. Your commit messages should be concise and make clear what exactly you achieved in your code changes within your commit. Making random and general messages like "code done" or "lab finished" will be very unclear for both you and future readers of your code.
