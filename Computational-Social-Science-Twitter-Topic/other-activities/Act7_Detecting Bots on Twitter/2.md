<!--title="User Activity"-->

Now we are going to release our inner Sherlock Holmesüîç! We suspect that any user tweeting and retweeting thousands of times a day must be a **robot** (or a person how has a lot to say :0)!

The following line of code will get our tweets from data frame which we made in a previous activity and sort them by their usernames. We will then be able to see all tweets each person is associated with and will be able to scan through our list and pick off the non-humans!

```python
usertweets = tweets.groupby('Username')
```
