# Introduction 
 
For this lab we will utilize the skills you've gained working with APIs to visualize tweets using **tweepy**.

The idea is simple, given a topic, all hashtags with greater than 5% frequency pertaining to that topic are plotted in a pie graph. All hashtags with less than 5% frequency fall under an "Other" category.

Hashtags provide an efficient way of deducing how tweeters feel about the topic they are tweeting about, since Twitter users use hashtags to summarize their tweets, often with more emotion. Therefore hashtags provide a sufficient summary of the tweet - there is a lesser need to process every character and word of a tweet if the hashtags are available. 

By seeing the most common hashtags associated with a topic, we can evaluate what Twitter users are discussing under the scope of a greater topic and how people feel about the topic at hand. It's easy to get caught in our own echo chambers on social media, and analyzing the most common hashtags across *all* tweets for a certain topic helps us analyze the feelings behind a topic in a more objective manner. 

Here is an example of what we will be aiming to accomplish at the end of this lab:

Just like in previous labs, set up your authentication keys and tokens in Python.
