# steps

## 1-2 Step 1
### name
```
Registering our client application with Twitter
```

### md_content 
```
Now that you have set up our credentials, create an `OAuthHandler` Instance from our `Tweepy` library and assign it to a variable `auth`.

The OAuthHandler Instance is a function which takes two parameters, `consumer_key` and `consumer_secret`. 
```
## 1-2 Step 2
### name
Storing Access Tokens for later use

### md_content
```
Let's move on to storing our access tokens. Twitter currently does not expire tokens, so it is better to store our tokens now rather than re-fetching them every time. 

Use the `set_access_token()` function as a sub-function of the variable `auth.`
