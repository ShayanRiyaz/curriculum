Please answer the following questions:

1. What is the dominant tone (positive, negative, or neutral) of tweets about COVID-19?
2. Pick five popular celebrities. What are their most popular hashtags? Do those popular celebrities tweet about the 2020 election, about the Democratic candidates (which one), about COVID-19, about global warming, or about gun control? 

These questions were developed by Professor Wojcieszak of the Dept of Communications at UC Davis. Thank you Professor!
