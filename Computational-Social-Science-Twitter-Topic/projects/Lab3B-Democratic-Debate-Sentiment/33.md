<!--title={init_dataframes()}-->

Now let's fill out `init_dataframes()`. Call your method `produce_dataframe` on the defined dictionaries `low_cost_search` and `luxury_search` to produce two dataframes which consist of sentiment data on low-cost airlines and luxury airlines. Print *the entirety* of these dataframes to the Python console and return *both* of them.
