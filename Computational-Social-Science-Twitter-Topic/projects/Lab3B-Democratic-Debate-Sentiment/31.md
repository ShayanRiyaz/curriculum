Our end result is going to be a dataframe indexed by sentiment categories `['positive', 'neutral', 'negative']` and our columns being names of various political candidates. From this dataframe, one should be able to easily look up the number of positive/neutral/negative tweets regarding an candidate. 

Firstly, make a empty dataframe `df` indexed by the array `['positive', 'neutral', 'negative']`.

`dem_search` simply is a dictionary with candidate names mapped to appropriate search queries on Twitter. We can use `tweepy` to search for tweets including those search queries. 

For each search query, use the `Cursor` object from `tweepy` to generate n number of tweets including each query. (n corresponds to the parameter `num_tweets` in this case.)
