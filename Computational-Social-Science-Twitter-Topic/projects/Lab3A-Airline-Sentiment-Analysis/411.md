<!--title={Creating a time series dataframe}-->

We can search for the tweets related to an airline the same way we did before, but no we're going to choose one airline to search for instead of all of the airlines in the search dictionary. We've picked United Airlines in our example, but you can choose from any of the other ones in the search dictionary. 

Create a new function with the declartion `def findDays(num_tweets)`. And start writing your code into it.

The first thing we should do is create our twitter cursor object like we did before. The statement below is creating the cursor object that will stop at 1000 tweets and get tweets since three days ago. Please put this code block below/outside your function for now.

```python
tweets = tw.Cursor(api.search,
                      q="united airlines",
                      lang="en",
                      since=date_since).items(1000)
```

Now that we have `tweets` , our cursor object, we need to actually create a loop for the tweepy object to collect the tweets for us. The Tweepy cursor object in the background will get 1000 tweets using your API keys.
