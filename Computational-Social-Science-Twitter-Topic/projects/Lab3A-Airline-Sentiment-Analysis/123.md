After creating your app, head to its “Keys and tokens” section, where you will find an API key and API secret key.

Below the consumer API keys, there is also an area to generate an access token and access secret token, please generate them and keep track of those as well.



Copy these keys into your starter code where the example is: 

```python
consumer_key = "Your key goes here!"
consumer_secret = "Your key goes here!"
access_token = "Your key goes here!"
access_token_secret = "Your key goes here!
```
