<!--title={Creating a Time Series Dataframe}-->

Our first step is to create a dataframe with the raw dates and sentiments for each tweets. You can follow this process: 

1. Pick an airline from the `search_dict` dictionary (we chose United Airlines!) and get the related tweets using the Twitter API. You can search for the tweet since the variable `date_since`, which has an already calculated value of 3 days ago. 
2. Create the empty Time Series Dataframe. Name the columns `date`, and `sentiment`. 
3. Fill the time series dataframe by analyzing each tweet. Like before, tweets should be categorized into `postive`, `neutral`, or `negative`. 

Once we've created the time series dataframe, we can create percentages of tweets from that!
