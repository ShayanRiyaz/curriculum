Now we are going to put the 15 **most common words** pertaining to that hashtag into a DataFrame, which we will graph later.

Your DataFrame must have the following characteristics:

* Has two columns 'words' and 'count'
* all words must be converted to lowercase
* Only **individual** words 

Hint #1: the Python module `collections` has a `Counter` object you can use to automatically count words.

Hint #2: the line `list(itertools.chain(*list_name))` will combine lists within a list. For example:

```python
test_list = [['a', 'b'], ['c', 'd']]
list(itertools.chain(*test_list)) # will yield a list of ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd']
```
