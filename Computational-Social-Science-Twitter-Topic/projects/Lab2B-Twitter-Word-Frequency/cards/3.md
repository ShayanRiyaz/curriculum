If you try printing out your list of tweets, there are most likely links within the text of many tweets. While links are important for the text content, when parsing through tweets, links don't contribute to word count and make the runtime of our Python code much longer.
 
Therefore, we will use **regular expressions** to accomplish the data cleaning. Throughout the previous labs you have gone through you may by now know that cleaning data is the longest portion of analysis projects.

Please code a function `remove_url(txt)` that removes all URLs from a text string. Adding on to your code in the last part, then use that function to remove all URLs from every tweet's text **before processing hashtags**.
