# Introduction

For this lab we will utilize the skills you've gained working with APIs to visualize tweets using **tweepy**.

Just like in previous labs, set up your authentication keys and tokens in Python. For styling, please make sure to include the following code at the beginning of your main function:

```python
    warnings.filterwarnings("ignore")

    sns.set(font_scale=1.5)
    sns.set_style("whitegrid")
```
