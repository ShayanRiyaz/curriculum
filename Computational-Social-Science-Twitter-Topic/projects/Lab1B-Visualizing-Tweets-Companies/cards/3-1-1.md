We could call the `OAuthHandler()` function from by `tweepy` library by using the dot operator. 

`tweepy.OAuthHandler()` is a function that returns an instance of an OAuthHandler object, which contains pre-written methods that will help you in the authorization process. It takes in 2 arguments, the consumer key and consumer secret. We can fill these in with the ones that were generated for you in the Twitter Developer App.
```
### code_snippet
```python
auth = tweepy.OAuthHandler(consumer_key, consumer_secret)
```
