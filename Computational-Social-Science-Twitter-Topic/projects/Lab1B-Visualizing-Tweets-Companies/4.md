Now that the `get_tweet()` function can help us get access to the user's tweets, we want it to help us obtain a number of tweets from the user into a **list** and write it to a new **.csv file**. 

A **.csv file** is a "comma separated value file". They are delimited text files that uses commas to separate values. You generally see them in the form of Excel spreadsheets. We're going to be using a .csv file to keep our data easily accessible and organized in rows and columns. This is what they look like!

First, we want to declare an empty **list** and name it `tfile` to store the extracted tweets from the user. Then, we can create a **for loop** to access the items in `tweepy.Cursor()` and append tweet data into the `tfile` list. [Here](http://docs.tweepy.org/en/v3.5.0/cursor_tutorial.html) is the documentation for `tweepy.Cursor()` function.


The information that we want to append into `tfile` are `username`, `tweet.id_str`, `tweet.source`, `tweet.created_at`, `tweet.retweet_count`, `tweet.favourite_count`, and `tweet.text.encode("utf-8")`.
