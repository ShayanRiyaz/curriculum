## 5-3-1 Step 1
### name
Creating a Data Frame
### md_content
```
Let's store the cleansed data into a dataframe.
Note:
`pd.DataFrame()` takes many parameters: data, index, columns, dtype, and copy, but we will only need to use the data and columns parameters. `data` is the information we are passing in, in our case the cleansed tweets in bg2, and `columns` is the column labels to be shown in our table.
```
### code_snippet
```python
bg3 = pd.DataFrame(bg2, columns = ['tweet'])
```
## 5-3-1 Step 2
### name
Print Them Out!
### md_content
```
Additionally, we can print out `bg3` to make sure we have the data frame output that we want.
```
