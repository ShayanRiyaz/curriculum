## 5-1 Step 1
### name
```
Generate the .csv File 
```

### md_content
```
Let's define a `main()` function and do the rest of our tasks there! In this function, we start by obtaining the tweet-filled .csv file with the specific username, using the `get_tweets()` function we previously defined.
```

## 5-1 Step 2
### name
Read the .csv File and Check How It Goes!
### md_content
```
To read the .csv file that we generated from the `get_tweets()` function, we declare a variable `bg` that calls the function `read_csv()` from the `pandas` library.

Check it by printing out the first 5 rows of data from `bg` using the `head()` function.
