## 4-2-2 Step 1
### name
Opening the new .csv File
### md_content
```
Open and write in the .csv file by using the following line of code:
```
### code_snippet
```python
with open(outfile,'w+') as file:
```
## 4-2-2 Step 2
### name
In What Form Do We Want To Store Our Data
### md_content
```
Under the opened file, use the `csv.writer(file,delimiter)`function to specify how our data should be separated. In this case, we want them to be separated by a comma. Store the return value of the function in a variable called `writer`.
```
### code_snippet
```python
writer = cvs.writer(outfile, delimiter=",")
```
## 4-2-2 Step 3
### name
Writing to the .csv File
### md_content
```
With the variable `writer`, we want to write in our .csv file. To make our data tidy and easy to understand, we write the categories on the first row of the .csv file and then add the data from `tfile` in the rows below it as shown:
```
### code_snippet
```python
# category headings in the first row
writer.writerow(['User_Name','Tweet_ID','Source','Created_date','Retweet_count',
                 'Favourite_count','Tweet'])
# data follows
writer.writerow(tfile)
```
