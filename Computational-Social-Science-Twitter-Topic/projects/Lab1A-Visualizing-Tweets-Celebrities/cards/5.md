The next thing we will move on to is to create our main function. 

This function puts the tweets that we have obtained into a .csv file using the previous function we defined, then, cleanse them, and output a Wordcloud based on the highest number of repeated words.

We will create a **dataframe** before we output as a Wordcloud. A dataFrame is a data structure with columns containing potentially different types of information. You can think of it like a spreadsheet or a SQL table.
