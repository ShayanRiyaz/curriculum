## 5-1-2 Step 1
### name
```
Read Through the Tweets Data
```
### md_content
```
Now we have the .csv file generated by the `get_tweets()` function, and we would like to read through it and store it in the variable `bg` by using `read_csv()`.
```
### code_snippet
```python
bg = pd.read_csv(<csv_filename>,encoding='utf-8')
```
## 5-1-2 Step 2
### name
```
Print Them Out!
```
### md_content
```
You can print the first `n` rows from your .csv file by using  `print(bg.head(n))` to make sure everything is going smoothly.

This will print out the first n items in `bg`.
