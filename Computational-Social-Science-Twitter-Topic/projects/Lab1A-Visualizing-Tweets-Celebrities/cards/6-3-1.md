Displaying WordCloud
```
### md_content
```

After we have created our Wordcloud, we want to display it. Functions from the `matplotlib.pyplot` library can help us do this. 

We start by plotting a figure:
```
### code_snippet
```python
fig = matplotlib.pyplot.figure(1)
```

## 6-3-1 Step 2
### name
```
Adjusting Parameters of the Figure
```
### md_content
```
Then, we can adjust some parameters such as `imshow()`, and `axis()`, and we can display our wordcloud by using `show()`.
`matplotlib.pyplot.imshow()` displays the image, but does not store the image data of your wordcloud. We're calling it here to check to see if our wordcloud looks correct.

`matplotlib.pyplot.axis('off')` hides the axes so that we get a clean looking wordcloud.

`matplotlib.pyplot.show()` starts an event loop, looks for all currently active figure objects, and opens one or more interactive windows that display your figure or figures.
```

### code_snippet
```python
matplotlib.pyplot.imshow(<your_wordcloud>)
matplotlib.pyplot.axis('off')
matplotlib.pyplot.show()
```

## 6-3-1 Step 3
### name
```
Maybe You Want to Save Your WordCloud
```
### md_content
```
Once you have done the above, you can choose to add another line of code to save the Wordcloud you generated with the `savefig()` function as shown, and you can include other parameters you want to set in the `savefig()`. Click [here](https://matplotlib.org/3.1.1/api/pyplot_summary.html) to see all the parameters.
```
### code_snippet
```python
fig.savefig("<your_wordcloud_file_name>")
```
