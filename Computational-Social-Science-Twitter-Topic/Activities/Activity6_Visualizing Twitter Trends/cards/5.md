# Evaluating if Tweets are Replies

Now, we'll evaluate if the downloaded *tweets* are a reply to some other users' *tweets*. This is done similarly to the previous part but it also checks for the absence of certain fields within the JSON object by using the `not` operator. We will use the ‘*in_reply_to_screen_name*’ field, so that aside from seeing if the tweet is a response or not,  we can see which user the *tweet* is responding to.

```python
def is_Reply_to(tweet):
    if 'in_reply_to_screen_name' not in tweet:
        return False      
    else:
        return tweet['in_reply_to_screen_name']
```
