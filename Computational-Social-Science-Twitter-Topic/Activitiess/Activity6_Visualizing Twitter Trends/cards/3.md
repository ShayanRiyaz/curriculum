# Reading and Processing Data

Then, we will read the data that we have collected and process it. Remember that the output of the Streaming API is a JSON object for each tweet, with many fields that can provide very useful information. In the following block of code, we read these tweets from the .txt file where they are stored. However, let's break it down so we can see what is exactly going on here!

We setup a list to hold our tweet data and open the file where we have said tweet data. **Make sure you change your `tweets_data_path`** to the file name where you stored your tweets.

```python
if __name__ == '__main__':
    # Reading the raw data collected from the Twitter Streaming API using Tweepy. 
    tweets_data = []
    tweets_data_path = '' # change to your filename!
    tweets_file = open(tweets_data_path, "r") 
```

Next, we go through our file and add all the tweet data to our list. What the `try` block does is simple: it tests if we can do an action (in this case open and read a line in a file). If we cannot, we run the code in the `except` block (In this case, the `continue` keyword triggers the next line in the file).

```python
    for line in tweets_file:
        try:
            tweet = json.loads(line)
            tweets_data.append(tweet)
        except:
            continue
```

After reading the .txt file above, run the following line of code. This line gets rid of all tweets that were corrupted due to connection issues or other errors.

```python
    #Error codes from the Twitter API can be inside the .txt document, #take them off
    tweets_data = [x for x in tweets_data if not isinstance(x, int)]
```

Now, you can see how many *tweets* we have collected by inserting this line of code into your main function:

```python
    print("The total number of Tweets is:",len(tweets_data))
```
