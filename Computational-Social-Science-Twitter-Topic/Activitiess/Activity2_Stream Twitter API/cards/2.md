Now we are going to start working with Twitter data!

To start, create a new Python file called **twitter_data.py** and we will need to import several packages* from Tweepy: OAuthHandler, Stream, StreamListener

```python
from tweepy.streaming import StreamListener
from tweepy import OAuthHandler
from tweepy import Stream
```

*A package is a sub-library of a library that holds functions to do a very specific task.

##### What are these libraries?

OAuthHandler will take your consumer token and secret to authenticate you and give you access to Twitter data.

Stream creates a streaming session so you can have Twitter data in real time and communicates with **StreamListener**. 

StreamListener routes information (directly connecting the content that you see).
