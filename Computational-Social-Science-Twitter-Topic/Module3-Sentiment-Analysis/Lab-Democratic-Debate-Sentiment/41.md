# Setting Up Bars

Remember that even though this is a stacked bar graph, you are still essentially graphing numbers on a bar graph, with the caveat that the bars are on top of each other, and so the location of the bars needs to be controlled.

To make your bars on your graph, there are two steps you need to take:

* Locate the positive, neutral and negative lists in your data frame. That is the data you will be graphing.
* Use `plt.bar` to graph bar graphs. 
  * Start off with just graphing the positive bars and making sure those work.
  * Then graph the neutral bars, setting the **bottom** to be the positive bars.
  * Do the same for negative bars.
