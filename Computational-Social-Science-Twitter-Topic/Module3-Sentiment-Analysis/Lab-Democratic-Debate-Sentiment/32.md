<!--title={Sentiment Analysis for produce_dataframe()}-->

<!--concepts={indexingDataframes.mdx}-->

In our `Cursor` object is a list of tweets with our search query. 

Iterate through this cursor object and find whether its sentiment is positive, neutral or negative.

* You'll have to use `TextBlob` as well as the `sentiment.polarity` attribute.

Keep track of a count of positive, neutral and negative tweets.

When done iterating through the tweets, index the dataframe so that the sentiment data shows up in your dataframe. 

The function should return `df`.
