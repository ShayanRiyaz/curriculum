<!--title={Create your Twitter app}-->

In the creation of your app, fill out all the required information for your app details. For the website URL field, you can input any website, we used https://bitproject.org.  Leave the OAuth Callback URL, TOS and Privacy Policy fields blank. 

 OAuth Callback URLs are used for providing directions on where a user should go after signing in with their Twitter credentials. They can even be used to redirect a user to a spcific page, which won't be neccessary for our lab.

TOS stands for 'terms of service' which again, we don't need to specify here.

Privacy Policy is similar to TOS, but would explain to users what the data collected from them would be used for. Since there will be no users other than yourself, it is not relevant.
