## Add Sentiment to Our Data Frame

Now that we've built our function that tells us the sentiment of the tweets, we can now integrate that data into our data frame. We will add the sentiments of each tweet as a new column in our data frame (and populate it with each tweet's respective sentiment).

The following code should be added under `if __name__ == '__main__'`:


```python
df['sentiment'] = np.array([tweet_analyzer.analyze_sentiment(tweet) for tweet in df['tweets']])
```

You should see a new column in your data frame that looks like this:
