# Data Analysis: Mentions But Not Retweets

Now lets see the percentage of tweets that have **mentions but are not retweets**. Note that these *tweets* include the previous reply tweets. The tweets with mentions that are not replies or retweets are just tweets that include said mention somewhere in the middle of the text. Think of `~` as a not operator and the `&` as the and operator. So the expression `~tweets['text'].str.contains("RT")` is equivalent to saying: "get the tweet Data Frame's text column and only get those tweets  who don't who aren't retweets(which are marked by an RT in the text)". A similar idea can be extended to `tweets['text'].str.contains("@")`

```python
    #See the percentage of tweets from the initial set that have #mentions and are not retweets:
    mention_tweets = tweets[not tweets['text'].str.contains("RT") and tweets['text'].str.contains("@")]
    print("The percentage of retweets is {round(len(mention_tweets)/len(tweets)*100)}% of all the tweets")
```
