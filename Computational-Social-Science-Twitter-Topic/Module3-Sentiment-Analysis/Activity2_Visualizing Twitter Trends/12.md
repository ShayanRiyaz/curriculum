# Data Visualization of Tweet Categories

With all the percentages we got from the previous part of the activity, we will use them to create a visualization.

First, let's make a plot out of all of these categories to better compare their proportions:

We  first prepare two lists (one containing all the number of the various types of tweets we want to display) and the other the names of each of the corresponding types. This is the acutal core data that we will be soon expressing in our graph.

```python
#Now we will plot all the different categories. Note that the reply #tweets are inside the mention tweets
len_list = [ len(tweets), len(RT_tweets),len(mention_tweets), len(reply_tweets), len(plain_text_tweets)]
item_list = ['All Tweets','Retweets', 'Mentions', 'Replies', 'Plain text tweets']
```

Here we set up our graph(giving it a size, grid layout, and title). 

```python
plt.figure(figsize=(15,8))
sns.set(style="darkgrid")
plt.title('Tweet categories', fontsize = 20)
```

Finally, we label our axes and fill said axes with data!

```python
plt.xlabel('Type of tweet')
plt.ylabel('Number of tweets')
```

We finally plot the graph and show it to the user!

```python
sns.barplot(x = item_list, y = len_list, edgecolor = 'black', linewidth=1)
plt.show()
```



When running this piece of code in your Python file, you see a graph similar to this.
