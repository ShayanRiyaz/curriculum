# Checking for Retweets

Now that we have read in the .txt file and have our tweets in JSON format ready, we will implement some functions to map some of the parameters of these JSON objects to columns of a Pandas dataframe where we will store the *tweets* from now on. 

First, create a function that allows us to see if the selected *tweet* is a *retweet* or not. This is done in a by evaluating if the JSON object includes a field called ‘*retweeted status’* or not. If the tweet is not a retweet then the field 'retweeted_status' would never be in the JSON object corresponding to that tweet. If the tweet is a retweet, True is returned, otherwise it is False.

```python
#Create a function to see if the tweet is a retweet
def is_RT(tweet):
    if 'retweeted_status' not in tweet:
        return False      
    else:
        return True
```
