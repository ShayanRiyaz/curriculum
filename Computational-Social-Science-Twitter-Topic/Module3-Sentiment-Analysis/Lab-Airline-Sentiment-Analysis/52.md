# Adding our data points

Now that your bars are set up, your graph has no data! Lets fix that!

List "x" is used for plotting. for the line graphs below, (x, y) points need to be plotted. the "x" is just a list from 0...N - 1

`  x = [n for n in range(0, N)]`

Now lets create an  array representing amount of positive tweets per day, taken from the dataframe's row using loc.

`  y_pos = np.array(df.loc['positive', :])`

Now lets create an array representing amount of neutral tweets per day, taken from the dataframe's row using loc

`  y_neut = np.array(df.loc['neutral', :])`

Finally, an array representing amount of negative tweets per day, taken from the dataframe's row using loc

`  y_neg = np.array(df.loc['negative', :])`
