# Making Graph Pretty

Now that your bars are set up, your graph most likely looks unorganized. To organize our graph better, we can set margins to the x ticks to space them out. Because the specifics of how to space out x tick labels can get quite complicated and out of the scope of this bootcamp, I'll provide a chunk of code for you here:

```python
# space out x ticks and give margins
plt.gca().margins(x=0)
plt.gcf().canvas.draw()
tl = plt.gca().get_xticklabels()
maxsize = max([t.get_window_extent().width for t in tl])
m = 0.1 # inch margin
s = maxsize/plt.gcf().dpi*7+2*m
margin = m/plt.gcf().get_size_inches()[0]

plt.gcf().subplots_adjust(left=margin, right=1.-margin)
plt.gcf().set_size_inches(s, plt.gcf().get_size_inches()[1])
```

This code should space out your x ticks and set margins.

Don't forget a title (`plt.title`) and a legend (`plt.legend`)!
