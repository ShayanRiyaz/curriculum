<!--title={Creating the Percentages Dataframe}-->

Now that we've created the time series dataframe, we can create a dataframe that counts the percentages of `positive`, `neutral`, and `negative` tweets. The row at the bottom will be titled `total`, and will be the total amount of tweets for that day. Now, we create the empty dataframe called `df`, created with `pd.Dataframe()`

But first we need to create a dictionary for the date for our dataframe:

```
  date_dict = {}
  # constructing dictionary for DataFrame
  for date in dates:
    date_dict[date] = [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0]
  print(date_dict)
```

Now, we create the empty dataframe called `df`, created with `pd.Dataframe()`

```python
df = pd.DataFrame()
```

Then, we'll fill in the dataframe with zeroes and and create the row/column names: 

```python
df = pd.DataFrame(date_dict, index=['positive', 'neutral', 'negative', 'total'])
```

If you printed the dataframe, it would look like this:

|          | date1 | date2 | date3 | date4 |
| -------- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| positive | 0.0   | 0.0   | 0.0   | 0.0   |
| neutral  | 0.0   | 0.0   | 0.0   | 0.0   |
| negative | 0.0   | 0.0   | 0.0   | 0.0   |
| total    | 0.0   | 0.0   | 0.0   | 0.0   |

Great job! Next we'll fill up the data frame!
