<!--title={Getting the tweets for the time series dataframe}-->

Now that everything is set up, let's get our tweets and their corresponding sentiments. We should loop through all of the tweets the cursor object will get. 

```python
for t in tweets:
    # analyze our tweets here!
```

First, let's get the date the tweet was created: 

```python
for t in tweets: 
	text_create.append(t.created_at)
```

Above we're adding to the `text_create` list the time the date was created at. 

Next we should get the sentiment of the tweet. We can access this using `t.text` and analyze it using `Textblob()`.  The *polarity* of the analysis is what we want to access, and this can be positive if >0, neutral if 0, and negative if <0. 

```python
for t in tweets:
    text_create.append(t.created_at)
    analysis = TextBlob(t.text)

    if analysis.sentiment.polarity > 0:
        text_sentiment.append('positive')
    elif analysis.sentiment.polarity == 0:
        text_sentiment.append('neutral')
    else:
        text_sentiment.append('negative')
```

Finally, our lists are full of all the tweets and their sentiments! Let's add them into our dataframe. 

```python
time_series_df['date'] = text_create
time_series_df['sentiment'] = text_sentiment
```

Great, now all you need is to conver this raw dataframe into a different dataframe with percentages of each kind of sentiment for each day!
