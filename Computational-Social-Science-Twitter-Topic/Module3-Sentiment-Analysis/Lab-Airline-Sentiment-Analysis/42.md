<!--title={Creating the Percentages Dataframe}-->

Now that we have our time series dataframe with each tweet and it's corresponding sentiment, we can create a different dataframe with the percentages of each tweet per day. Try this process: 

1. Create the dataframe. The dataframe columns should be each day since `date_since`, and the row names should be `positive`, `neutral`, `negative`, and `total`. 
2. Calculate the total number of tweets for each day. The numbers will be in the row `total`. 
3. Calculate the percentage of `positive`, `neutral`, and `negative` for each day.
