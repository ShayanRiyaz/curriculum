<!--title={Setting up Dataframes for the Graph}-->

We currently have a dataframe containing the dates and sentiments for the airlines we searched for. We now want to calculate the total tweets and the percentages of positive/neutral/negative tweets for a specific airline



The goal for this card is to create a *new* dataframe that's columns are the dates of the tweets, and the rows are labeled `positive`, `neutral`, `negative`, and `total`. The rows `positive`, `neutral`, and `negative` will be the percentage of tweets across the day, and `total` will be an integer, the number of tweetsfor that day. 



To do this, choose just *one* airline whose data you will perform analysis on, and create a dataframe that looks like the one below:
