# Text Labels

To add text labels, we'll have to iterate through all the bars and append an appropriate label to each one. So firstly, set up a list called `labels`, that has all the positive, neutral and negative data *in one list*. 

We can use `ax.patches` to find a list of all the bars currently in the graph. We can then `zip` the labels and patches together, iterate through that, and for each patch use `ax.text` to attribute a label to each bar. Make sure you have an appropriate location when using `ax.text`!
