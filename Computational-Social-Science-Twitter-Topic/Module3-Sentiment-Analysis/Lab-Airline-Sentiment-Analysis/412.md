<!--title={Getting the tweets for the time series dataframe}-->

Since we've got our Tweepy cursor object, we should create a dataframe to read the tweets into. Below is an empty dataframe with the columns titled `date` and `sentiment`. 

```python
time_series_df = pd.DataFrame(pd.np.empty((0, 2)))
time_series_df.columns = ['date', 'sentiment']
```

We'll also need two lists, one for the date, and one for the corresonding sentiment. Let's call these `text_create` (for dates) and `test_sentiment` (for sentiments). 

```python
text_create = []
text_sentiment = []
```
