# Handling Twitter Authentication

Next, we will handle Twitter authentication and the connection to the Twitter API. To do so, we will need to create the `auth` variable to authenticate using the credentials we have in the **twitter_credentials.py** file. We will use the OAuthHandler from the Tweepy module to authenticate our "Consumer Key" and "Consumer Secret". To complete the authenication process, we will set the access token to the "Access Token" and "Access Token Secret" from that same file. 

```python
listener = StdOutListener()
auth = OAuthHandler(twitter_credentials.CONSUMER_KEY, twitter_credentials.CONSUMER_SECRET)
auth.set_access_token(twitter_credentials.ACCESS_TOKEN, twitter_credentials.ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET)
```

Next, we will create a stream using the **Stream** class from the Tweepy module and pass in the auth and listener objects. 
 
```python
stream = Stream(auth, listener)
```

We will also filter tweets with specific keywords when streaming in the data. To do so, we will use "track" to track those keywords, which is provided through the `tracklist` parameter. 

```python
stream.filter(track = tracklist)
```

Here is what the Python code should look like in your **tweepy_streamer.py** file under your **TwitterStreamer** class. (all of this code will be run as the "main" code, that is what the first line is doing)

```python
if __name__ == '__main__':
    # Twitter Authentication
    listener = StdOutListener()
    auth = OAuthHandler(twitter_credentials.CONSUMER_KEY, twitter_credentials.CONSUMER_SECRET)
    auth.set_access_token(twitter_credentials.ACCESS_TOKEN, twitter_credentials.ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET)

    stream = Stream(auth, listener) 		 # create Stream class
    stream.filter(track = hash_tag_list) # filter keywords
```
