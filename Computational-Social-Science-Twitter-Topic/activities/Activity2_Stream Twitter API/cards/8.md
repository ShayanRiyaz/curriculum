Now that we have a class set up to retrieve data, let's learn how to read it!

Currently our data is in a text file but we want the data in a JSON file. The following loop accomplishes this task. 

```python
tweet_count = 0
max_tweets = 10

if __name__ == '__main__':
  tweets_data = []
  tweets_file = open(tweets_data_path, "r")
  for line in tweets_file:
    try:
      tweet = json.loads(line)
      tweets_data.append(tweet)
    except:
      continue
```
The code above reads from a file and turns all your data from just lines of information into a JSON file. We want to use a JSON file because itâ€™s a very easy format to access your data and it organizes it into very nice sections. 

An example JSON file would look like this:

```JSON
{
    "NBA_Teams": {
        "Golden State Warriors": {
            players: ["Stephen Curry",
                     "Klay Thompson",
                     ...]
        },        
        "Boston Celtics": {
            players: ["Kemba Walker",
                     "Jayson Tatum", 
                     ...]
        }                                  
    }
}
```

As you can see, it is easy to understand the nested structure of data using JSON.

For those of you more familiar with Python, JSON files are easy to parse in Python because they are essentially represented as nested **dictionaries**.
