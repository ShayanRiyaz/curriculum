# Configuring Access Tokens

Before continuing with this activity, we'll first have to secure access to the Twitter Streaming API using the tokens we got from the last activity. 

For the rest of the activities, we will be using **Google Colab**. 

Create a new file called **twitter_credentials.py** and paste the following code: (with your credentials)

```python
ACCESS_TOKEN = "insert_access_token_here"        			
ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET = "insert_access_token_secret_here"
CONSUMER_KEY = "insert_consumer_key_here"
CONSUMER_SECRET = "insert_consumer_secret_here"
```
