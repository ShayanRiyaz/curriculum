<!--title={Retrieving Data Pt.1}-->

Hypothetically, we only wanted a certain sample size of 100 tweets for our research project. We can actually modify our code in order to limit the number of tweets we want to download, by keeping track of the maximum number of tweets in the `on_data` function and disconnecting the stream when the limit is reached.

We'll first need to set some global variables outside of the class that will keep track of the :

```python
# global variables for limiting number of tweets
tweet_count = 0
max_tweets = 10
```

These need to be defined outside of the class. Since `on_data` runs every time a tweet is streamed, if we kept track of them inside `on_data` then we would lose the values of those variables every time a new tweet is processed. 
 
We can use an if-else statement that counts the number of tweets weâ€™ve downloaded and disconnects the stream when we exceed a certain number.

```python
class StdOutListener(StreamListener):
  	def on_data(self, data):
    	global tweet_count
    	global max_tweets
    	global stream
    	if tweet_count < max_tweets:
      		print(data)
      		tweet_count += 1
      		return True
    	else:
      		stream.disconnect()
  	def on_error(self, status):
    	print(status)
```

With this new if-else statement, we can control when we disconnect the stream.
