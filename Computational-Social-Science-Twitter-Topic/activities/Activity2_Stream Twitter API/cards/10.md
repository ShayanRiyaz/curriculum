Let’s make a data frame!

Add the following code under `if __name__ == '__main__'`:

```python
    tweets = pd.DataFrame()
    tweets['text'] = list(map(lambda tweet: tweet['text'], tweets_data))
    tweets['Username'] = list(map(lambda tweet: tweet['user']['screen_name'], tweets_data))
    tweets['Timestamp'] = list(map(lambda tweet: tweet['created_at'], tweets_data))
    print(tweets.head())
```
This block of code creates our dataframe and will display the tweet, the username, and when the tweet was made. As we are extracting data with the combo of lambda, map, and list and setting it to something like tweets[“user”], we will get a column of users in our data frame. We can only do this because the file was formatted in JSON! Doesn't JSON make everything seem simple?

pd.DataFrame() is a function from pandas that will make a new data frame object, in our case, a data frame named tweets. 

Remember how we turned our data file to a JSON format?  We’re going to extract contents from it now!

We need to extract all the tweets from our `tweets_data` JSON object. We want to process the text, username and timestamp of each tweet. 

We can use a concept called **lambda functions**. Lambda functions are essentially one-line functions that are unnamed. You can use lambda functions alongside the `map` keyword to run lambda functions on every entity in a list of entities. In this case, we want to run a lambda function on each of our tweets in our JSON data.

The following statement

 ```python
map(lambda tweet: tweet['text'], tweets_data)
 ```

will iterate through every object in `tweets_data` and run the lambda function on each object. After running the lambda function, its output will be stored in an "iterator" object. (for the sake of this activity you don't need to know what exactly this means). To use this object and access the tweets inside you can use the `list` keyword to convert the iterator object into a list that we can easily process and use.

Therefore, the statement

```python
tweets['text'] = list(map(lambda tweet: tweet['text'], tweets_data))
```

will gather a list of each tweet's text in `tweets_data` and set that list to the "text" column in the `tweets` DataFrame. 

Lambda functions combined with `map` are very powerful!

### Final Output

Save and run your file in terminal! You should see output like this appear in your command line:

Although we set a maximum amount of tweets we want in our code, the amount actually can vary from 0-max_tweets, depending on how long you let it run and how fast your computer is. So don't worry if it has less than max tweets!
