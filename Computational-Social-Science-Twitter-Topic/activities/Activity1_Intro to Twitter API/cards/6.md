# Download Python, Create Twitter Account, Install Tweepy

*Note that the following part is optional - if you would like to develop on Python locally on your machine, you should follow these instructions to download Python and run Python scripts on your machine. *
   
In today's activity, we are going to recreate the Twitter application, which is called Tweepy. We will be utilizing an API, which can be accessed via Python, to stream tweets in real time directly from Twitter. 
 
Before beginning to create the application, you first must have Python installed onto your computer. You can do so, go to [**python.org/downloads**](**python.org/downloads**) and install the latest version.

Once you have done that, you will also need to make a Twitter account if you do not already have one. If you already have an existing account, you can skip this step. Otherwise, go onto [**twitter.com**](twitter.com), click on the **Sign up** button and fill out your personal information.

Now that you have Python installed and have an existing Twitter account, we are going to install the Python package **Tweepy**. To install Tweepy, open your Terminal on your computer. Use your terminal to navigate into the folder where you will be creating this activity. Once that is done, enter this shell command to install Tweepy:

```
$ pip install tweepy
```

That line will install the tweepy module so that you can use its different functions to recreate the Twitter application. Once it's done installing, you should see something like this:
