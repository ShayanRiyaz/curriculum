# Data Analysis: Retweets

Now that our data is all organized onto the Dataframe, we will now analyze it.

First, let's see how many ***tweets* are *retweets***. This code will give you the percentage of retweets within your set of tweets. Think of the `{}` as math expressions (i.e whatever is inside you imagine we evaluate them like regular python expressions) that are embedded in our print statements. So `{round(len(RT_tweets)/len(tweets)*100)}%`, rounds the percent ratio of retweets over the total number of tweets in our dataset.

```python
    #See the percentage of tweets from the initial set that are #retweets:
    RT_tweets = tweets[tweets['RT'] == True]
    print("The percentage of retweets is {round(len(RT_tweets)/len(tweets)*100)}% of all the tweets")
```

You will notice that you will get a somewhat high percentage in retweets. This indicates that most users do not produce their own content but instead forward content from other users.
