# Data Analysis: Plain Text Tweets

Lastly, lets see how many *tweets* are just **plain text *tweets***, with no mention or retweets. This is the same as the previous code with the only exception that we add another negation or not operator to the first expression and swapped around their places!

```python
# See how many tweets inside are plain text tweets (No RT or mention)
plain_text_tweets = tweets[~tweets['text'].str.contains("@")  & ~tweets['text'].str.contains("RT")]
print("The percentage of retweets is {round(len(plain_text_tweets)/len(tweets)*100)}% of all the tweets")
```

With all of these percentage, we will now plot it and create a visualization. Continue to the next part of the activity to create the visualization.
