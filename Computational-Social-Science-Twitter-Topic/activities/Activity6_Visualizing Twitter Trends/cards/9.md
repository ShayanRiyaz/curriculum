# Data Analysis: Replies

Next, we will analyze how many *tweets* are downloaded from the Streaming API that are **replies to *tweets*** of another user.

```python
    #See the percentage of tweets from the initial set that are replies #to tweets of another user:
    reply_tweets = tweets[tweets['Reply'].apply(type) == str]
    print(f"The percentage of retweets is {round(len(reply_tweets)/len(tweets)*100)}% of all the tweets")
```

You will notice that the percentage is low since a small percentage of users reply to other users' tweets.
