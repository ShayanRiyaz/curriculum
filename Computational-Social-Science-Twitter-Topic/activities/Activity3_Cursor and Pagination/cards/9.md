# Explaining Cursor

Here is the original function for getting a user's timeline tweets:

```python
    def get_user_timeline_tweets(self, num_tweets):
        tweets = [] # empty list for tweets
        for tweet in Cursor(self.twitter_client.user_timeline).items(num_tweets):
            tweets.append(tweet)
        return tweets
``` 

There's a method for every `twitter_client` object of every `TwitterClient` with a user timeline functionality that allows you to specify a user to get the tweets off that user's timeline. We have not specified a user; therefore, it defaults to you and will get tweets from your own timeline. There's a parameter for the cursor object called `.items` that allows you to specify the amount of tweets to receive from the timeline.

Now let's test what we have works so far.

Under `if name _ == '__main__':` insert

```python
	twitter_client = TwitterClient()
    print(twitter_client.get_user_timeline_tweets(1))
```

Comment out the following lines, as they are not necessary for this test:

```python
#   twitter_streamer = TwitterStreamer()
#   twitter_streamer.stream_tweets(fetched_tweets_filename, hash_tag_list)
```

If it works properly, you should get the most recent tweets from your Twitter timeline.
