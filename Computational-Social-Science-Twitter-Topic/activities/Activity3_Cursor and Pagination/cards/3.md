After defining those two classes, it's time to use them! We'll define our hashtag list (Note that it does not have to be hashtags, it can be any text you want tweets to contain.)

We'll also define a filename where we want our tweets to be stored, for our `StdOutListener`. 

Then we initialize an instance of the `TwitterStreamer`, and start streaming tweets using the given filename and hashtag list.

```python
if __name__ == '__main__':
 
    # Authenticate using config.py and connect to Twitter Streaming API.
    hash_tag_list = ["donald trump", "hillary clinton", "barack obama", "bernie sanders"]
    fetched_tweets_filename = "tweets.txt"

    twitter_streamer = TwitterStreamer()
    twitter_streamer.stream_tweets(fetched_tweets_filename, hash_tag_list)
```
