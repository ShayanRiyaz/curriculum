Since we moved authentication into its own class `TwitterAuthenticator`, we have to make a couple changes to the `TwitterStreamer` class:

- Our initializer must initialize an instance of a `TwitterAuthenticator` class. 

```python
def __init__(self):
	self.twitter_authenticator = TwitterAuthenticator()  
```

The above setups our authentication (i.e shows Twitter our credentials, which in turn allow us to use their services).

* Modify the `stream_tweets` function to authorize using the `TwitterAuthenticator` class.

```python
	def stream_tweets(self, fetched_tweets_filename, hash_tag_list):
        listener = TwitterListener(fetched_tweets_filename)
        auth = self.twitter_authenticator.authenticate_twitter_app() #added this line
        stream = Stream(auth, listener)
        # This line filter Twitter Streams to capture data by the keywords: 
        stream.filter(track=hash_tag_list)
```

Now `stream_tweets` will listen to tweets filtered by `hash_tag_list`, just like normal. The difference is that we are using the Authenticator object to simplify the authentication process rather than authenticating directly.
