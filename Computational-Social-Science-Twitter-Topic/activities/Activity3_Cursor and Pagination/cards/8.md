Now, we are going to make use of the cursor module that we imported as well as extract timeline tweets from your own timeline.

Let's start by declaring a new class and constructor method:

```python
class TwitterClient():
  def __init__(self, twitter_user=None):
        self.auth = TwitterAuthenticator().authenticate_twitter_app()
        self.twitter_client = API(self.auth)
        self.twitter_user = twitter_user
```

>self.auth is a TwitterAuthenticator object (We use this to properly authenticate to communicate with the Twitter API)

Note that in the fourth line, we use the API class provided by `tweepy` - the API class provides many methods that offer access to Twitter API "endpoints", or points where an application can access data from an API.

 Now, let's make a function within this TwitterClient class that allows a user to get tweets:

```python
    def get_user_timeline_tweets(self, num_tweets):
        tweets = [] # empty list for tweets
        for tweet in Cursor(self.twitter_client.user_timeline).items(num_tweets):
            tweets.append(tweet)
        return tweets
```

> The paramenter num_tweets allows us to know how many tweets we actually want to show or extract.

Given an API instance (in this case `twitter_client.user_timeline`), the Cursor class given by `tweepy` returns all of the tweets directly, without needing any processing. Without a Cursor the code to process all tweets would look more like this:

```python
page = 1
tweets = []
# note that this gets all tweets from a user's timeline
def get_user_timeline_tweets(self):
    while True:
        timeline_tweets = api.user_timeline(page=page)
        if timeline_tweets:
            for tweet in timeline_tweets:
                # process status here
                tweets.append(status)
        else:
            # All done
            break
        page += 1 # next page 	
```
