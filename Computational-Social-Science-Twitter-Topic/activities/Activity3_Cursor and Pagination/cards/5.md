# Making Authentication into Its Own Class

You wouldn't want to let unauthorized users messing with your account,right? Here "authentication" comes into play. So lets integrate it right into our class so it becomes an integral part of all our requests to the Twitter API.  

Now let's abstract the Authentication into its own class so that we can use it to authenticate for other purposes in this activity. Abstraction makes our code more understandable even though we are doing some very complex things in the background. 

First, we are going to do some changes to the code we wrote in **tweepy_streamer.py**:

- Change ```class StdOutListener(StreamListener)``` to ```class TwitterListener(StreamListener)```

  - The TwitterListener

- Remember to also change the function call also (Ex: ``` listener = StdOutListener(fetched_tweets_filename)``` to ``` listener = TwitterListener(fetched_tweets_filename)```)

- We are also going to abstract the authentication into its own class. We are going to authenticate for other purposes, so it would be useful to put all authentication within its own class:

  ```python
  # # # # TWITTER AUTHENTICATOR # # # #
  class TwitterAuthenticator():
  
      def authenticate_twitter_app(self):
          auth = OAuthHandler(twitter_credentials.CONSUMER_KEY, twitter_credentials.CONSUMER_SECRET)
          auth.set_access_token(twitter_credentials.ACCESS_TOKEN, twitter_credentials.ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET)
          return auth
  ```

  - Abstraction allows implementation of various functions without needing to know how they work
    - it helps make complex code look simpler by hiding the mechanism for certain functions
  - OAuth plays a part here by processing the Twitter credentials and returning a token to ensure that only those who are authorized can access the account and data
