Let's start by setting up the Twitter API. Firstly, let's setup a function inside our `TwitterClient` class that will return the API. Remeber, we are not adding object oriented features to make our life harder, these abstractions or high-level calls and methods will make our code readable and easy to extend or add on to, especiallt when we start with bigger and more complex data sets. This will help us understand what we are doing more clearly later on. We do so as follows:

```python
def get_twitter_client_api(self):
    return self.twitter_client
```

This function will return the Twitter client object associated with an instance of a TwitterClient class. Remember that a TwitterClient object allows for access to the user timeline, friend list, etc, as described in the last activity (Cursor and Pagination).
