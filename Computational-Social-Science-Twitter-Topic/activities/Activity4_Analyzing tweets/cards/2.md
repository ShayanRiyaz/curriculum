# Insight into JSON

We store all our tweets in a *"JSON"* format (this becomes important in the later cards). But what is JSON and why are we using it!

JSON stands for **JavaScript Object Notation**. In essence, it is a standardized data writing format based on the way the programming language JavaScript stores its objects.

Think of JSON as a compressed way of writing things like Morse code! It can be decoded and read by programs  in such a way that makes it more intuitive to handle data.

But what does "intuitive" mean here? You'll soon find out!

#### Writing and Reading JSON

***

You always start a JSON file with brackets, with each data element seperated by a ```,```:

```
{
	...,
}
```

You then add your data in a key-value format! You can think of the key as a category or type while the value is the actual data. Something like this: `"Key":"Value",` .  You can also make lists in your JSON file!

``` 
{
	"Name" : "John Smith",
	"Age" : 23,
	"College" : "UC Redding",
	"Favorite Colleges" : ["UC Redding", "UC Santa Rosa" , "UC San Jose"],
}
```

> Notice we implicitly specify the types of our data above by using ".." for strings and numbers without quotations as integers.
