# Analyzing the tweets
 
Finally the most exciting part...analyzing the tweets! We already have the text field set up so now let's add columns for other fields such as the id, likes, retweets, etc. We do so by using the numpy arrays and adding one column at a time. The data fed into this is similar to what we did before.

The following line will go through the tweets we send in and gives us the tweet id(think of it as a unique id number given to each tweet). We then make a id column in our data frame and add the respective data to each tweet in said table/data frame.

```python
df['id'] = np.array([tweet.id for tweet in tweets])
```

The following line will go through the tweets we send in and gives us the **textual length of each tweet**. We then make a length column in our data frame and add the respective data to each tweet in said table/data frame.

```python
df['len'] = np.array([len(tweet.text) for tweet in tweets])
```

We can do the same for the date a tweet was created, the type of device it came from, the number of likes, and the number of retweets.

```python
df['date'] = np.array([tweet.created_at for tweet in tweets])
df['source'] = np.array([tweet.source for tweet in tweets])
df['likes'] = np.array([tweet.favorite_count for tweet in tweets])
df['retweets'] = np.array([tweet.retweet_count for tweet in tweets])
```

So what we have now is(by using `print(df.head(10))` to get the first 10 items in our Data Frame),
