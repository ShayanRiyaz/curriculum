## Making a Bigram with a Cleaned Tweet

We're going to doing the analyzing part since we got all the tweet prepped. For a sample, we're just going to play with the first tweet for now.

Add this code:

```python
terms_bigram = [list(bigrams(tweet)) for tweet in tweets_nsw_nc]

terms_bigram[0]
tweets_no_urls[0]
```

Here, we'll a list of each tweet turned into bigrams. 

Let's see how the bigrams turn out! If you run your program, the second line of code should print out the very first item of your list and the third line should print out how the tweet originally looks like after being cleaned. It should just look something like this printed:

```python
[('januarys', 'dry'), ('dry', 'handsravaged'), ('handsravaged', 'landturning'), ('landturning', 'timberto'), ('timberto', 'ashsinew'), ('ashsinew', 'tosmokelivelihood'), ('tosmokelivelihood', 'nogoodonly')('nogoodonly', 'words'), ('words', 'holl')]
Januarys dry handsravaged our landturning timberto ashsinew tosmokelivelihood nogoodonly words some holl
```

Notice how the the tweet has changed. In the list, you can see that they're paired up with words that came before and after them in the text. This is an simple example of the bigram model. 

If you want, you're welcome to try any other tweet in your list by chainging the indexes of ``terms_bigram[0]`` and ``tweets_no_urls[0]``. (Number 0 to 999 only becuase remember, we only collected 1000 of the most recent tweets! )

Note: you can comment out the 2 lines of code that will print stuff so that moving on, you won't have to see them again when we run the program.
