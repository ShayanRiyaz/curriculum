## Libraries

Before we start, let's do the basics so we have access to data and have a smooth sailing through this activity.

Open up a new file in your editor of choice. You probably want to store it in the folder where you have all your other Twitter APL activities' code to keep things organized. 

In your new file, you should import these libraries:
```python
import os
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns
import itertools
import collections

import tweepy as tw
import nltk
from nltk import bigrams
from nltk.corpus import stopwords
import re
import networkx as nx

import warnings
```
We will be needing these libraries for our work.
