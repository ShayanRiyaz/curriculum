# Analyzing Tweets

Right now, your tweet output most likely looks really ugly in your terminal. We'll create a DataFrame that allows us to organize all of this data.

We'll start by creating a class that we'll be using to analyze our tweets later. Let's call this class `TweetAnalyzer`.  Now let's create a function `tweets_to_data_frame` that will take the JSON data we have and convert it into a data frame categorized by the text for our future use.

Here, the Pandas library has an inbuilt function `DataFrame()` that does the conversion of our tweet data into a DataFrame. 

We feed in the data by iterating through our `tweets` object and feeding in the `tweet.text`. 

The expression `[tweet.text for tweet in tweets]` is what is known as a **list comprehension**. It iterates through all of the tweets in-place, and for every `tweet`, its text is appended to the list. The `data` attribute of our DataFrame, therefore, is a list of just the text associated with each tweet. Remember that `tweets` is a JSON object, and we can use the `.` operator to get the text in each tweet.

```python
class TweetAnalyzer():
    def tweets_to_data_frame(self, tweets):
    	df = pd.DataFrame(data=[tweet.text for tweet in tweets], columns=['Tweets'])
        return df
```

Now to take advantage of this newly created class, we are going to create a object of this class inside our **main** routine and call the function on tweets.

```python
tweet_analyzer = TweetAnalyzer()
df = tweet_analyzer.tweets_to_data_frame(tweets)
```

 Now let's print the first 10 `tweets` in our Data Frame by `print(df.head(10))`.

Now what we can do is we can go ahead and create a data frame which is going to store that content and just going to allow us to neatly organize that and also to process it for further data analysis later so we're going to make use of the Numpy and Pandas modules that we imported.
