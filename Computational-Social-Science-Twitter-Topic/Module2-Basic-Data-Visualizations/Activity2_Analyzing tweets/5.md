# Setting up main

Next, let's **erase** everything under `if __name__ == 'main'`. Please do that before proceeding. 

We'll create an instance of a TwitterClient class, which we'll use to analyze the tweet data of the user we'll be specifying:

```python
	twitter_client = TwitterClient()
```


Now let's get the API through the function we just created and store it inside a variable for analyzing in the future. With this object we will be able to access the other and fundamental parts of our class (i.e methods that actually modify and manipulate our tweets).

```python
	api = twitter_client.get_twitter_client_api()
```

To get tweets from any user, we can use our `api` object. We have learned how to obtain a user's timeline tweets in past activities, and we use the same strategy here:

```python
	tweets = api.user_timeline(screen_name="Oprah", count=10)
```

The `tweets` variable will contain 10 tweets from Oprah Winfrey.

If you run your code now, you should see the 10 most recent tweets from Oprah.
