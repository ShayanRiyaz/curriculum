# Continue from Streaming Live Tweets

In this part of the activity, we will now continue writing the code for the Tweepy application. Start off by importing two things to the Python file named **tweepy_streamer.py** which we will use in this activity to make it more streamlined and modular:

```python
from tweepy import API
from tweepy import Cursor
```

To follow this activity, here are two classes we will start with. 

The `StdOutListener` class is a generic class that outputs any tweets received to a given filename `fetched_tweets_filename`. 

```python
# # # # TWITTER STREAM LISTENER # # # #
class StdOutListener(StreamListener):
    """
    This is a basic listener that just prints received tweets to stdout.
    """
    def __init__(self, fetched_tweets_filename):
        self.fetched_tweets_filename = fetched_tweets_filename

    def on_data(self, data):
        try:
            print(data)
            with open(self.fetched_tweets_filename, 'a') as tf:
                tf.write(data)
            return True
        except BaseException as e:
            print("Error on_data %s" % str(e))
        return True
          

    def on_error(self, status):
        print(status)
```
