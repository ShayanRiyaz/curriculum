##### What are dataframes?

- Comes from the pandas library 
- 2-dimensional and has 2 axises, x (rows) and y (columns). 
- holds data, for example, this one hold data about basketball players on the Boston Celtics. 
- Similar to a chart.
- In this case, we will use a dataframe to organize all our data

For our dataframe, we will need to import more libraries at the top of our code. 

```python
import json
import pandas as pd
# path where streamed tweets are located from part 1
tweets_data_path = "twitter_data.txt"
```
Pandas is a great module that we can use to create a dataframe. JSON is a text format that will be explain later.
