<!--title={JSON Files}-->

Let's learn briefly about JSON files as that is the format our data is going to be presented in!

An open-standard file format or data interchange format that uses human-readable text to transmit data objects consisting of attribute–value pairs and array data types.

JSON is popular because it’s similar looking to a dictionary in Python and super readable.

Here's an example:

##### Extracting from JSON

JSON format makes extracting data super simple. You can see that in the file, there are little sections with a ‘title’. 

To take the data from a section, it would be json[section] . . . [section]. It will give you everything within the curly brackets next to the section name.

Assuming the entire JSON above is represented under the variable `data`:
  `data[quiz]` will give you everything in the file
  `data[quiz][maths]` will give you everything within the bracket next to maths
