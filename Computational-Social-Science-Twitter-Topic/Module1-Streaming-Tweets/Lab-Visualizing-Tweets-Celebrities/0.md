Before we start to write the program obtaining tweets, we should be able to use the python-twitter API client first.

To do that, you need to acquire and declare a set of application tokens. 



Token is a form of authentication that an application will use when requesting access to your service. You can think of it like a username/password. Your service will generate tokens for the application to use when accessing your service, such as analyzing your data. So we want to obtain this tokens first.



These tokens will be your `consumer_key` and `consumer_secret`, which get passed to `twitter.Api()` when starting your application.

Name the tokens `consumer_key`, `consumer_secret`, `access_token_key`, and `access_token_secret`.

### Join as a Developer

First, Head over to the website https://developer.twitter.com/en/apply-for-access to create a Twitter Developer Account and click the "Create New App" button. Fill out the fields on the next page that looks like this:

### Create APP and Obtain Tokens

After your app is created, you will see a new page that shows some information about your app.

Click on the  “Keys and Access Tokens” tab on the top of the page, you will find `consumer_key`, `consumer_secret`, `access_token_key`, and `access_token_secret`.

Copy the information needed and declare the keys as follows:

```python
consumer_key = '<your_consumer_key>'
consumer_secret = '<consumer_secret>'
access_token_key = '<access_token_key>'
access_token_secret = '<access_token_secret>'
```

By the end of this step, you should have gotten the `consumer_key`
