<!--title={Creating Wordcloud}-->

The next thing we want to do is to create the Wordcloud using `STOPWORDS` and `WordCloud` from the `wordcloud` library. 

### Step 1:  Setting Stopwords

Set the stopwords using `set(STOPWORDS)`. 

### Step 2:  Create the WordCloud

Create the wordcloud using the function `WordCloud().generate()`. 

To use the function, we need to join the tweets together first.

The `join()` method takes **iterable**, which are objects that are capable of returning its members one at a time. For example, List, Tuple, String, Dictionary and Set are all iterable.

The parameters we want to edit in the `WordCloud()` function are `background_color`, `stopwords`, `max_words`, `max_font_size`, and `random_state`.
