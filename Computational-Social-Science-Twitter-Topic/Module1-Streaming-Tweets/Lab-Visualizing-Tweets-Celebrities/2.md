Now, let's start to get the tweets from the celebrity. To do this, we create a function to extract tweets. 



Define a function called `get_tweet()` which takes the parameter `username`. Then, gain authorization to the **consumer key** and **consumer secret**.

A **consumer key** is the key that a service provider, in our case Twitter, issues to a consumer that allows the consumer to access the API. **Consumer secret** is the consumer "password" that is used along with the consumer key.



The next thing we want to do is to gain access to the **access key** and **access secret**.

The **access token** and **access secret** are used to make API requests on your account's behalf.



Once we are done with the authorization procedure, we move on by calling the API.
