<!--title={Visualizing Tweets}-->

To do this project in Python using `tweepy`, a Python library for accessing the Twitter API, you should start off by importing our necessary libraries. **Libraries** are importable packages of prewritten code that anyone can use. This way, we don't have to start our code completely from scratch! The libraries we will be using are:

`tweepy`, `pandas`, `sys`, `csv`, `WordCloud` and `STOPWORDS` from `wordcloud`, `matplotlib`, `matplotlib.pyplot`, `string`, `re`, `PIL`



The next thing we want is to be able to use the python-twitter API client.  To do that, you need to acquire and declare a set of application tokens, which we have already done. Name the tokens `consumer_key`, `consumer_secret`, `access_token_key`, and `access_token_secret`.
