<!--title={Copying Tweets To .csv File}-->

### Step 1: Opening the new .cvs File

Open and write in the .csv file by using the following line of code:

```python
with open(outfile,'w+') as file:
```

`open()` is a function that, you guessed it, opens files! The first argument it takes is the name of the file. It also takes a second optional argument that determines whether we are reading or writing to the file. The default setting for the second argument is reading the file. Because we want to write to this file, we set a second argument `'w+'`. 



### Step 2: Setting Up Writer

Under the opened file, use the `csv.writer(file,delimiter)` function to specify how our data should be separated. This function will help us write to the .csv file. Because we are creating a .csv file, we want each of our values to be separated by a comma, so we set the delimiter as a comma.

In this case, we want each of our data to be separated by a comma. Declare this function in a variable called `writer`.

```python
writer = cvs.writer(outfile, delimiter=",")
```



### Step 3: Writing to the .csv File

Using `writer`, we want to write in our .csv file. To make our data tidy and easy to understand, we write the categories on the first row of the .csv file and then add the data from `tfile` in the rows below it as shown:

```python
writer.writerow(['User_Name','Tweet_ID','Source','Created_date',
                 'Retweet_count','Favourite_count','Tweet'])
writer.writerow(tfile)
```
