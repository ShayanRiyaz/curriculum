<!--title={Setting Parameters Of Wordcloud Figure}-->

### Step 1: Setting WordCloud Figure Parameters

We start by setting the parameters of our Wordcloud plot. Use the `rcParams()` function from the `matplotlib` library to do so, as follows:

```python
mpl.rcParams['<parameter>'] = <set_your_parameters_here>
```

The parameters we want to set are `figure.figsize`, `font.size`, `savefig.dpi`, and `figure.subplot.bottom`.



For example, we can set `figure.figsize` to [3.5, 6.5] by

```python
mpl.rcParams['figure.figsize'] = [3.5, 6.5]
```



### Step 2: Additional Information on Parameters

The parameters `figure.figsize` and `font.size` should be pretty straight forward, you can set them to any integer value you'd like. 

`savefig.dpi` also can be set as an integer value. The value you set it to will be the resolution in dots per inch. 

`figure.subplot.bottom` sets the subplot layout. And it has parameters `left`, `right`, `bottom`, `top`, `wspace`,`hspace` to adjust. `wspace` is the amount of width reserved between subplots, and should expressed as a fraction of the average axis width.

`hspace` is similar to `wspace` and it's the height reserved between subplots.
