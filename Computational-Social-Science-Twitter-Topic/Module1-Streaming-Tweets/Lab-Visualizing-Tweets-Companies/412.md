<!--title={Reading The .csv File Of Tweets}-->

### Step 1: Read Through the Tweets Data

Now we have the .cvs file generated by the `get_tweets()` function, and we would like to read through it and store it in the variable `bg` by using `read_cvs()`.

```python
bg = pd.read_csv(<csv_filename>,encoding='utf-8')
```



### Step 2: Print Them Out!

You can print the first `n` rows from your .csv file by using `print(bg.head(n))` to make sure everything is going smoothly.

This will print out the first n items in `bg`.
