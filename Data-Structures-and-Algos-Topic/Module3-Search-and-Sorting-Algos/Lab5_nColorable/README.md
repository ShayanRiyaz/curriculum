# Activity/Lab Name
nColorable

# Long Summary
Students will learn to solve the classic n-Colorable graph problem. They will be using Depth First Search (DFS) to solve the problem. They will also learn about Backtracking Search and implement that into their solution.

# Short Summary
Students will solve the n-Colorable problem using Depth First Search and Backtracking Search.

# Criteria
1. Why are we using Depth First Search instead of Breadth First Search?
2. What is the purpose of using Backtracking Search?
3. Why do we represent the graph as an adjacency matrix?

# Difficulty
