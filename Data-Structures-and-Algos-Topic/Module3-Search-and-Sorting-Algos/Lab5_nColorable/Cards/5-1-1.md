### Step 1ï¼š`main()`

The `main()` function is responsible for calling all appropriate functions and getting user input. Here is a proper implementation of the `main()` function:

```Python
def main():
    # Call fileReader() function to get 2D list graph
    graph = fileReader("test.csv")
    
    # Get numVertices by getting length of graph
    numVertices = len(graph)
    
    # Get user input for n
    n = int(input("Enter n: "))
    
    # Call initColors() to initialize colors list
    colors = initColors(numVertices)
    
    #Call the graphColoring() function and if it returns false, that means that the graph can't be colored
    if graphColoring(graph, n colors, 0, numVertices) == False:
        print("Graph cannot be colored")
    else:
        print("The color assignments are: ")
        for color in colors:
            print(color)
```

Note that your `main()` function may not look exactly like this, and that is okay. Just make sure your code has all the desired functionality for the program to work correctly. Also note that in this case, the file with the adjacency matrix provided by the user is called `test.csv`.
