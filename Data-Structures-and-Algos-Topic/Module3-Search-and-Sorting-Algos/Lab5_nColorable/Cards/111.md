In the algorithm, we can use **DFS** to inspect all nodes in our graph and assign a color to each. In order to speed up the process, we can use **Backtracking Search**. Backtracking search will track which colors are valid for a specific vertex. A color is valid if no connecting nodes already have it assigned. If no viable color can be assigned to a vertex (no valid color exists for this node), the program will determine that the graph is not n-Colorable.







Let's see this in action with the graph we saw earlier:

In this case, `n` = 2 and red and blue are our chosen colors. Let's walk through step by step to see how this assignment was reached. Assume we used a preorder search pattern. We first assigned a color to `1`. Let's assume that we attempted to assign blue first, then red second. Since this was the first node, we had no problem assigning blue to it. We then moved on to `2`. 

Here is where backtracking search came in. First, we checked to see if we could assign blue as its color. We couldn't because `2` is connected to `1`, which is blue, so we had to assign `2` to be red. Then, we moved on to `4`.

We attempted to assign blue to `4`. No problem! It is not connected to any blue nodes, so we could assign its color to be blue. At this point, we have finished traversing `1`'s left tree, so we moved to its right tree. We then looked at `3`.

Could we have assigned blue to `3`? No, for the same reason as `2`. Since `3` is connected to `1`, which was assigned the color blue, we have to assign the color red. You'd think we would move on to `4`, but wait! We already assigned this node its color. At this point, DFS has completed traversing the graph, which means we have solved the problem and shown that this graph is n-Colorable!
