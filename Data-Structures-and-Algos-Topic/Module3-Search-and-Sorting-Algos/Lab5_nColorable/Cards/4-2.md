**Step 1: DFS**

In this function, you will be using **DFS** to inspect all of the graph's vertices. 

**Step 2: Backtracking Search**

You will be using **Backtracking Search** to tell if a certain vertex does not have a valid color. If that is the case, the function will return `False` to main.

Since we want to use **Backtracking Search** in our algorithm, our `graphColoring()` function could take advantage of the previous one `checkVertex()` to check if the vertex currently being inspected has a valid color. If there isn't a valid color, `graphColoring()` should acknowledge this and return `False` so that `main()` knows that the graph is not n-Colorable.

Also, don't forget to do your color assigning to vertices in the colors list. 

Note that you may find recursion helpful for this part (DFS).
