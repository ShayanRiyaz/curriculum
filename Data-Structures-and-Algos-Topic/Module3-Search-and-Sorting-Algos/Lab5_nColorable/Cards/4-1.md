### Step 1: Check if we can assign the color to the vertex

Before we get into functions that will assign the colors, it is a good idea to build a function that checks whether or not a certain vertex can be assigned a specified color. To do so, it must check whether any connecting vertices already have that color assignment. Try building a `checkVertex()` function. This function will allow us to implement backtracking search in `graphColoring()`.
