Since we will have colors assigned to all vertices, we must initialize a colors list that is numVertices long. It is okay to initialize the list to all 0s because we will be changing them later on in the program. In other words, using our sample list:

To create this list, we first need to determine its length. In this case, the length is `4`, the number of nodes in our example graph. We would then need to initialize all values in the created list to `0` before populating them later with the values shown above.
