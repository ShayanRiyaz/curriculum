### Step 1: Check if we can assign the color to the vertex

Before we get into the functions that will assign the colors, it is a good idea to build a function that, when given a certain vertex and color, it checks if that vertex can be assigned that color. To do so, the function must check whether any connecting vertices already have that color assignment. Try building a `checkVertex()` function. This function will allow us to implement backtracking search in `graphColoring()`.
