DFS  and Backtracking Search
```

```
In the algorithm, we can use **DFS** to inspect all nodes in our graph and assign a color to each one. In order to quicken the process, we can use **Backtracking Search**. Backtracking search will keep track of which colors are valid for a specific vertex. It will also ensure that the color assigned to the vertex currently being inspected has not been assigned to a connecting vertex. If no possible color can be assigned to a vertex, the backtracking search will indicate as such and the program will acknowledge that the graph is not n-Colorable.
