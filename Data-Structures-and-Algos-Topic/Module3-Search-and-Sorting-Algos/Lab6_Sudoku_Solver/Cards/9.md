# main() Part 2

![](https://cdn.livesudoku.com/artwork/singlesudoku-center.png)

After the user has successfully inputted a valid `grid`, we need to provide controls with possible options the user can use as their Sudoku board goes through the solving process. The UI for the controls will be prompted to the user as shown below:

```python
Controls:
	'Enter': Display the next move
	'p': Print the current grid (small)
	'c': Complete the grid (or attempt to)
  '(r,c)': Prints the possible options for that row, column
```

Controls:

- If the user pressed `Enter`: it will print the next move that occurred (solving one square in the Sudoku board).
- If the user pressed `p`: it will print the entire grid in its current state.
- If the user pressed `c`: it will complete the entire grid and print the final, finished Sudoku board if possible.
- If the user enters in a row, column pair `(r, c)`: it will print the possible values for that row, column pair (square).

Depending on whatever the user inputted, we must take that input and call the appropriate function for their request. You must check what the user inputted to drive whatever operation you'll be performing. 

Additionally, we will be using a timer in case the user enters `c` because we will provide them the time it takes to solve their Sudoku board. The timer is a simple implementation that will be handled using the **`time()`** function.
