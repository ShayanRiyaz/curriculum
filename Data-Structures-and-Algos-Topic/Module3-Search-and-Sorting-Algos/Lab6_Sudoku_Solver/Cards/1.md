# Introduction

For this lab, we will be building a **Sudoku solver** in Python.  For those unfamiliar with the game, there are many resources online with information on how to play. The basic rules of Sudoku are as follows: Each row, column, and nonet can only contain each number (typically 1 to 9) exactly once. The sum of all numbers in any nonet, row, or column must match the small number printed in its corner; for traditional Sudoku puzzles featuring numbers 1 to 9, this sum is equal to 45.

Your Sudoku Solver should be able to take an unfinished "Sudoku board", represented as a 9x9 2-D list, to solve the puzzle and output a finished board in the same format. 

For our program, this is what the initial board should look like:

```python
                            9 4 _ | _ 2 _ | 7 _ _		# the underscores (_) represent
                            _ _ 1 | _ _ 4 | _ _ 9		# blanks/empty on the Sudoku board
                            _ _ 6 | _ _ _ | 1 2 _	
                            ------|-------|-------
                            _ _ _ | _ _ 3 | _ 1 _
                            1 _ _ | _ _ _ | _ _ 8
                            _ 7 _ | 5 _ _ | _ _ _
                            ------|-------|-------
                            _ 8 7 | _ _ _ | 2 _ _
                            6 _ _ | 9 _ _ | 3 _ _
                            _ _ 9 | _ 8 _ | _ 5 7
```
The grid above would correspond to a 2-D list that looks like this:

```python
grid = [[9,4,0,0,2,0,7,0,0], [0,0,1,0,0,4,0,0,9], [0,0,6,0,0,0,1,2,0], [0,0,0,0,0,3,0,1,0],[1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8], [0,7,0,5,0,0,0,0,0], [0,8,7,0,0,0,2,0,0], [6,0,0,9,0,0,3,0,0], [0,0,9,0,8,0,0,5,7]]
```

#### Printing the Grid

We will start off by implementing the `printGrid()` function which will accept a 9x9 2-D list (as seen in the `grid` above) and printing it to the screen.  

**Note** that the `grid` contains 0 which doesn't exist in Sudoku. However, it represents a blank or empty spot in our Sudoku board. Thus, you will have to handle this case by converting the 0's to an underscore (`_`) before printing the board. 

Also, notice that the Sudoku board is broken into 9 quadrants where each quadrant is a 3x3 containing 9 numbers. We want to retain this Sudoku board format, so you must use pipes (`|`) to separate the column quadrants and dashes (`-`) to separate the row quadrants.

This process will consist of starting at the top of the sudoku board and printing each row as you generate and format them.

1) Step 1: We will simply start by defining our function, which accepts a grid:

```python
def printGrid(grid):
```
