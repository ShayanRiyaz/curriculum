# Introducing an Invalid Function

For this card, we'll introduce some ideas about the invalid grid. For the Sudoku Solver game, we don't need to duplicate each row, column and box. For example, if 1 appears twice in the first row, we call it invalid. 

## isValid()

Write the `isValid()` function, which will check the user's inputted Sudoku board's validity by making sure there are no duplicate values in any rows and columns. The function will take in one argument, the user's initial Sudoku board defined as `grid`. Remember that `grid` is a 2-D list containing 9 lists with 9 elements in each.

Here is an example of a valid grid that would return True from `isValid()`:

```python
9 4 _ | _ 2 _ | 7 _ _		
_ _ 1 | _ _ 4 | _ _ 9		
_ _ 6 | _ _ _ | 1 2 _	
------|-------|-------
 _ _ _ | _ _ 3 | _ 1 _
 1 _ _ | _ _ _ | _ _ 8
_ 7 _ | 5 _ _ | _ _ _
------|-------|-------
_ 8 7 | _ _ _ | 2 _ _
6 _ _ | 9 _ _ | 3 _ _
_ _ 9 | _ 8 _ | _ 5 7
```



Here is an example of an invalid grid that would return False from `isValid()`:

```python
3 _ _ | _ _ _ | _ _ _		
6 _ _ | 1 _ _ | _ _ 4		 
_ 9 _ | _ 3 3 | 2 5 _		
------|-------|-------	
_ 9 _ | 2 _ _ | _ _ _		
1 _ _ | _ _ 6 | 3 _ _
_ 7 _ | _ _ _ | _ 1 _
------|-------|-------
_ 1 2 | _ 8 7 | _ _ _
4 _ _ | 6 _ _ | 9 _ _
_ _ _ | _ 9 _ | _ 8 _
```

> 3's in the same row at [2, 4] and [2, 5] and 9's in same column at [2, 1] and [3, 1].
