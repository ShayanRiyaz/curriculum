# printGrid()


Remember that our grid is a 2-D matrix formatted as a 9x9, which means that we have a list containing 9 rows that have 9 elements each. We will need a **nested for-loop**, or two **for-loops** and two variables for **indexing**: one variable to iterate through the rows in `grid`, and another to iterate through the elements in each list within `grid`.  

(image to go here )

Step 2: Create the nested for-loop in the function using the two indexes and run through 0 to 8. 

In the first for-loop, `row_index` (say represented with variable "i") will be used to iterate through the rows in our `grid` (from 0 to 8). 

In the second for-loop, `index` (say reprsented with variable "j") will be used to iterate through each `element`(from 0 to 8) in the corresponding row.

Step 3: Create `rowString` that will store elements of the row. 

Within each for-loop, all that's left is a series of if/if-else statements with logic used to format the Sudoku board to be printed. At the end of each `row` generated, we print `rowString` at the end of the inner loop before moving on to the next row. 

**Note: Don't forget to store spaces and dashes at required places. Put dashes when 0 is the element (or where the square is empty).  **

For example, for the first row, the following must be stored in rowString:

```python
9 4 _  _ 2 _  7 _ _	# First row of sudoku board 
```
