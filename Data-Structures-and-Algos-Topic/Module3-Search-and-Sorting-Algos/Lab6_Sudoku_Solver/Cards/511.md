# nextMove()

Step 1: Define a variable `possible`.

We will simply define a variable `possible`, which will be assigned to the function `findPossible()`. Thus, `possible` will be assigned the list of available values (for our current square) returned from the function:

```python
	for r_i in range(0,9):
		for c_i in range(0,9):
			possible = findPossible(r_i,c_i,grid)
```


Step 2: Iterate through each row and column.

When iterating through all rows and columns to cover each square, we can check every square to see if possible values exist. This case is true if `possible` only contains one element because that element is the only value that can fill the current empty square! So, we will check if the length of `possible` is equal to 1:

```python
	for r_i in range(0,9):
		for c_i in range(0,9):
			possible = findPossible(r_i,c_i,grid)
			if len(possible) == 1:
```

Step 3: Use Booleans `foundMove` and `silent`.

If `len(possible) == 1` evaluates to `True`, then we know a move has been found! Thus, we will apply our logic using our Booleans `foundMove` and `silent` to print out the result:

```python
def nextMove(grid,silent=False,depth=0,finish=False):
	foundMove = False
	# Easy iteration through all spots, checking if clearly only one
	for r_i in range(0,9):
		for c_i in range(0,9):
			possible = findPossible(r_i,c_i,grid)
			if len(possible) == 1:
				if not foundMove:
					if not silent:
						print("(" + str(r_i+1) + "," + str(c_i+1) + ") -> " + str(possible[0]) + "  [Only possible]")
					grid[r_i][c_i] = possible[0]
					foundMove = True
```

Step 4: Print the prompt for the clause and set `foundMove = True`.

Since we know that `len(possible) == 1`, then the next if statement nested inside is `if not foundMove`, which will evaluate to `True` if `foundMove` is initially `False`. Following that is another nested if statement, `if not silent`, which evaluates to `True` since `silent` is initially `False`. All we have left to do is print the prompt for this clause and then set `foundMove = True`.
