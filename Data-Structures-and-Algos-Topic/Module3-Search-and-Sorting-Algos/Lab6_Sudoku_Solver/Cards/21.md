# isValid() Function


Earlier, we said that `isValid()` will verify that there are no duplicate values in any rows and columns. Thus, in our function, we will have to loop through our grid and have conditional logic to find any possible repeats in any of the rows or columns. 

Considering that we are storing our grid as a 2D list that contains 9 lists with 9 elements in each, our nested for-loop structure to navigate through the rows will be slightly different than that to navigate through the columns. Remember that each element of the 2D list is a list representing a row of the grid!

If we find a repeat in the grid, we will return `False`. If both nested for-loops iterate through the grid successfully, then the grid is deemed valid, so return `True`.

Starting off with the function definition, which takes the `grid` as an argument, we will have:

```python
def isValid(grid)
```

Step 1: Create two nested for-loops: one to check that all *rows* contain no repeats and another to check that the *elements* contain no repeats. If both nested for-loops iterate through the grid successfully, then the grid is deemed valid, so return True.
