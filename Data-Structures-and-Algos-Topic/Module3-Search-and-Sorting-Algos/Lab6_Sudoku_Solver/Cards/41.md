# findPossible() Function


As mentioned earlier, `findPossible()` will result in a list of possible valid values for a spot by observing the given spot's row, column, and nonet. 

Step 1: Confirm that the current square we are on is the number '0'. All squares that are empty will hold the value 0. 

Step 2: Build a list called `possible` to hold values from 0 to 9. As we search through the rows, columns, and within the box, we will remove values in `possible` that are found. 


Given that we have `r_i` and `c_i`, or the location of our square, we can use this information to iterate through the same row, column, and box to search for values with a for-loop. 

Step 3: Create for-loop
  * We will have a total of four for-loops: one for-loop to search through all values in the same row, one for-loop to search through all values in the same column, and two for-loops to search through all values within the same box as our square. 


Here are some hints and conditions that you should keep in mind while trying to implement this function:

* If a spot is **not** blank, a value has already been placed, so there are no "possible" values to find. Therefore, we will simply return an empty list to indicate that there are no possible values for our current square (`r_i`, `c_i`):
* We need to store all possible values and find a way to remove values that are invalid so that only possible values remain.
* We are given `r_i` and `c_i`. This is the location of the target square. We can use this to iterate through the same row, column, and box. When going through the row, column, and box, remember the dimensions of each box and the board as a whole.
