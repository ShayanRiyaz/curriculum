# nextMove()

Step 1: Initialize Boolean variable `boolean` and set to `False`.

Following our function header, we will first initialize another local Boolean variable called `foundMove`, which will be set to `False` until we have found a move in one of our three clauses. Thus, we will have this:

```python
def nextMove(grid,silent=False,depth=0,finish=False):
	foundMove = False
```


Step 2: Write a nested for-loop, iterate through all spots, and check if values are unique.

For our first clause, we will start with the easy case, iterating through all spots to check if there is only one possible value to replace an empty square. Thus, we will need a nested for-loop that iterates through all possible square (totaling 81). It will look like this:

```python
	for r_i in range(0,9):
		for c_i in range(0,9):
      # Implement logic here to find possible move
```


Step 3: Use `findPossible()` to find all possible answers for an empty square.

Remember that we will be using our `findPossible()` function to aid us in finding an answer for any and every empty square if possible. If we find a move, then print the value to be in place for the current square as seen in this example: `(8,9) -> 1  [Only possible]`



As of now, our function looks like this:

```python
def nextMove(grid,silent=False,depth=0,finish=False):
	foundMove = False
  	for r_i in range(0,9):
			for c_i in range(0,9):
      # Implement logic here to find possible move
```

Step 4: Implement the remaining logic.

All that's left for this clause is to implement the remaining logic in the case of finding a possible value via `findPossible()`. Otherwise, you will output nothing and just move on to clause 2.
