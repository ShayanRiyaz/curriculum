<!--title={Matchsticks to Square: Completing DFS Implementation}-->

After establishing the base cases for our nested `dfs()` algorithm, let's continue on to the remaining code:

For the matchstick selected with the current index, we have four different options. This means it can be part of any side of the square; we will test out all four options through recursion.

```python
for i in range(4):
```

Starting with the first option, we will check if the matchstick fits into the remaining space on the current side. If it does, we shall proceed by performing recursion.

Also, remember that `nums` is the parameter given to the `makesquare()` function, or the array of integers representing the lengths of each matchstick.

```python
if sums[i] + nums[index] <= possible_side:
	sums[i] += nums[index]
```

Then, if there is more recursion to be done, we will return `True` and continue.

```python
if dfs(index + 1):
	return True
```
If not, we will revert the effect of recursion since we no longer need it.

```python
sums[i] -= nums[index]
```

We are done coding the recursion process, but if the matchstick on the current index did not fulfill even the first condition (if the matchstick could fit into the remaining space on the current side), then the function will skip to the end and return `False`.

```python
return False        
```
Don't forget to return your result in the end!

```python
return dfs(0)
```
