Unlike in BFS and DFS, there are three time complexities for binary search. That is because in BFS and DFS, you have to traverse the whole graph. In binary search, however, you stop when you find what you are looking for.

Now, let us delve into the code: 

```python
def binarySearch (arr, l, r, x): 

	if r >= l: 

		mid = l + (r - l)/2

		if arr[mid] == x: 
			return mid 
		
		elif arr[mid] > x: 
			return binarySearch(arr, l, mid-1, x) 
    
		else: 
			return binarySearch(arr, mid + 1, r, x) 

	else: 
		return -1
```

### Best Case

The first time complexity is the best-case time complexity. This means that this is the best-case scenario, or the fastest that the algorithm will run.

In binary search, the best-case scenario is when the first value you look at after cutting the list in half is the value you are looking for. If this were to happen, then the best-case time complexity would be O(1) time. This can be seen in the second if statement of the code:

```python
if arr[mid] == x: 
	return mid 
```

As you can see, when the middle of the list arr is equal to what you are searching for, it immediately stops recursing. Therefore, if the value you are looking for is exactly in the middle of the first recursion, then you will immediately stop the algorithm.

### Average Case and Worst Case

The next two time complexities are called average case and worst case. Average case is the average of all run times. The worst case is the worst-case scenario, or the slowest the algorithm will run in.

In binary search, the worst case is when the algorithm can't find what it is looking for. In that case, the algorithm will keep on halving the list until it can no longer do so (meaning there is only one element left in the list). In that scenario, the worst-case time complexity would be O(logn) time, because you will NEVER actually iterate through the whole list. This can be seen in the elif and else statements of the code:

```python
elif arr[mid] > x: 
	return binarySearch(arr, l, mid-1, x) 
    
else: 
	return binarySearch(arr, mid + 1, r, x)
```

As you may notice, you will iterate only half of the list in each iteration, thus making it O(logn). Since the best-case scenario is very unlikely to happen, then the average-case time complexity shall be the same as the worst-case time complexity: O(logn).

### Why is binary search so good?

Now that we know the time complexities, what makes binary search so good? Well, the answer to that  is quite simple: It is the fastest known searching algorithm.

It has the best average time complexity amongst all searching algorithms available out there. In fact, it would not be a lie to say that if you were to create a better algorithm than binary search, then you would win an award.
