Before we start explaining the various time complexities of bubble sort, here is the code for the algorithm:

```python
def bubbleSort(bubble):
   for n in range(len(bubble)-1,0,-1):
    for i in range(n):
           if bubble[i] > bubble[i+1]:
               temp = bubble[i]
               bubble[i] = bubble[i+1]
               bubble[i+1] = temp
```

###Best Case

The best case scenario when doing bubble sort is when the list given to you is already sorted. In that case, the best case time complexity is O(n). That can be seen in the nested for loop:

```python
for n in range(len(bubble)-1,0,-1):
    for i in range(n):
      if bubble[i] > bubble[i+1]:
```

In this part of the algorithm, the algorithm checks if the current list is sorted or not. If it is not sorted, then the elements get swapped. In the best case scenario, since the list is already sorted, then the algorithm will only go through all of the elements once, thus giving us a best case time complexity of O(n).

### Worst case

The Worst case scenario is when the list is reversed. If that is so, the worst case time complexity is O(n^2). That can again be seen in the two for loops:

```Python
for n in range(len(bubble)-1,0,-1):
    for i in range(n):
      if bubble[i] > bubble[i+1]:
```

Since the list is reversed, then that means that while the first for loop is going through each and every element once, the second for loop will be busy doing the same thing again to swap the elements in the reversed list. And since one for loop takes O(n) time, a nested for loop like this will take O(n^2) time. Therefore, the worst time complexity of the bubble sort is O(n^2). 

###Average Case

The likelihood of the the list being either sorted or reversed is very small. However, the time complexity of the average case is O(n^2), just like the Worst case. That is because, even though the list is just semi-sorted, there will still be some action going on with the two for loops to ensure swapping happens in the list and the list gets sorted. And of the three cases, this is the most likely scenario to happen.
