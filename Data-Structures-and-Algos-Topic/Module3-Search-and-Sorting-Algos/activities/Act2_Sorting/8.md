# Merge Sort Theory

If we pretend to sort a deck of cards, merge sort is analogous to cutting the deck into smaller, more manageable groups and rearranging the cards before combining them back together.

This algorithm slightly differs from the previous algorithms we learned since it requires dividing the list into smaller parts before sorting everything together. We'll use a sample list again to show each concrete step:

1. First, divide the list in approximately two halves. In our exmaple, one half is bigger due to an odd number of elements in our list. After this first division, our sample list now looks like this:

2. Keep dividing each list in half until every original element is by itself:

3. Now, try and pair elements together in order. Here, we are trying to sort from smallest to largest. In our sample list, the `7` will have to be by itself:

4. Now, move on to pairing groups of elements. We make sure to sort all the elements first before combining them. After this step, our sample list will look like this:

   Simply do one more sort-and-combine step to get our fully sorted list:
