The insertion sort algorithm's time complexity is slightly different than the bubble sort. But before we head into that, here is the code for it as reference:

```Python
def insertionSort(arr): 
    for i in range(1, len(arr)): 
        key = arr[i] 
        j = i-1
        while j >= 0 and key < arr[j]:
        	arr[j+1] = arr[j]
        	j -= 1
        arr[j + 1] = key
```



### Insertion Sort Time Complexity

Unlike with bubble sort, the insertion sort only has one time complexity for all its cases. And that is because, regardless whether or not the list is already sorted , is in reversed order, or partially sorted, the time complexity will still remain as O(n^2). This can be seen in the two loops present in the code:

```Python
for i in range(1, len(arr)): 
        key = arr[i] 
        j = i-1
        while j >= 0 and key < arr[j]:
```

As you may have noticed, the two for loops will ALWAYS trigger, regardless of the state the list is in. It will only stop once all elements in the list has been visited by the first for loop. But, everytime the first for loop lands on an element, the while loop will then traverse the list again to check and see if there is a need to sort things out. Therefore, due to the two loops, the time complexity for all cases is O(n^2).
