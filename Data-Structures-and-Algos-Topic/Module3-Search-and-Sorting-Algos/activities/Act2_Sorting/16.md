To start off, we are given the definition of a singly linked list:

```python
function ListNode(val) {
      this.val = val;
      this.next = null;
  }
```

This function for the linked list is very important as you will see us using it to implement the solution. As a little explanation, the `this.val=val;` part simply makes the current val of the node you are in to be the val given as the argument for our ListNode function. The `this.next=null` simply makes the next val be null.
