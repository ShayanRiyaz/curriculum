In case you have forgotten, the Big O notation is used to describe the execution time required or the space used of an algorithm or code in computer science. Therefore, since BFS is an algorithm, it naturally has a Big O that can be used to describe its run time speed. We will start with the code from the previous card : 

```python
def BFS(self, s): 
  visited = [False] * (len(self.graph)) 
  queue = [] 
  queue.append(s) 
  visited[s] = True
  while queue:  
	s = queue.pop(0) 
	print (s, end = " ")
        for i in self.graph[s]: 
          if visited[i] == False: 
            queue.append(i) 
            visited[i] = True
```

As you might have noticed, there is a while loop in the BFS algorithm.

 ```python
while queue:
 ```

What this while loop is doing is going through each and every vertex inside the graph. Therefore, the Big O for this part of the algorithm is O(n). That is because the while loop will loop n times, where n is the size of the queue list that is being iterated over. 

The next significant part of the BFS algorithm that affects its time complexity is the for loop after the print statement. 

```python
for i in self.graph[s]:
```

What this for loop is doing is that it is visiting the adjacent vertices of the current vertex as stated previously.  Therefore it is going through each and every edge present in the graph. Just like the while loop before, the time complexity of this part of the algorithm will be O(n), where n is the size of the graph list.

###Combining Time Complexities

Now, when you combine the two, you would get O(n^2), as the for loop is inside the while loop.  The algorithm loops n times because of the while loop, and inside each while loop, you must again iterate another n times dues to the for loop, thus the reasult being O(n^2). However, that is not an accurate time complexity for BFS!

We got O(n) for the while loop because it is going through each and every vertex inside the graph, and an O(n) for the for loop because it is going through each and every edge inside the graph. However, an important thing to take note of is that the number of vertices and the number of edges are NOT the same. Therefore, a more accurate Big O for the algorithm is O(V +E), where V is the number of vertices being iterated over in the while loop and E being the number of edges being iterated over by the for loop. This again is unfortunately not completely accurate, as it will depend on the data structure that is being used in the BFS implementation

### Adjacency List vs Adjacency Matrix

Depending on if you use an adjacency list or an adjaceny matrix, the time complexity of the BFS will be change. Before we get into that, however, it is best to describe what the two data structures are.

 An adjacency list is a collection of unordered lists, where each list are neighbors to each other. This data strucutre is used for sparse graphs. A sparse graph is a graph where the number of edges is small, making the graph "sparse"

An adjacency matrix is a matrix that specifies which nodes in a graph are connected to each other.  This data structure is used for dense graphs. A dense graph is a graph where the number of edges is big, making the graph "dense"

Thus, if you use an adjacency list to implement BFS, then you will get a time complexity of O(V + E) and O(V^2) if you were to use an adjacency matrix. That is because, for an adjacency matrix, you will have to iterate over a matrix V^2 times, but in an adjacency list, it is just V+E times due to it just being a list of nodes.
