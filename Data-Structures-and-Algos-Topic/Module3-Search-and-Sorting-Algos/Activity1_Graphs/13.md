## Keys and Rooms
### Explanation
The key (no pun intented, hehe) to solving this problem is recognizing that the rooms and keys can be represented as a graph, and the goal is to check whether or not every vertex in the graph can be reached (if every room can be entered).

### Breakdown - Three Steps
Let's break this puzzle into three discrete steps.

**Step 1: Create the Graph**
The input is a list of lists, and we need to turn this into a graph. I have chosen to use the adjacency list to represent the graph, as it is intuitive to visualize. 

```python
  # 1. create adjacency list from rooms
  graph = {i:[] for i in range(len(rooms))}
  for j in range(len(rooms)):
    graph[j] = [key for key in rooms[j]]
```
