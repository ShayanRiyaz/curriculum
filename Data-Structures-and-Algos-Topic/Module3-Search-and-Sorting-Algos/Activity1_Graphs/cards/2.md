## Undirected Graphs

Undirected graphs have edges that do not have a direction. The edges indicate a *two-way* relationship, in that each edge can be traversed in both directions. This figure below shows a simple undirected graph. The absence of an arrow tells us that the graph is undirected.

> Undirected Graph



### Python Code:

```python
import networkx as nx
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

G = nx.Graph() #Create an empty graph with no nodes and no edges.
G.add_edges_from(
    [('A','B'),('B','C'),('C','D'),('D','E')]) #add edge AB, BC, CD, DE

nx.draw(G) #Draw the graph G with Matplotlib
plt.show() # display the graph
```

> add_edge: Add an edge between u and v. The nodes u and v will be automatically added if they are not already in the graph. Edge attributes can be specified with keywords or by providing a dictionary with key/value pairs.
