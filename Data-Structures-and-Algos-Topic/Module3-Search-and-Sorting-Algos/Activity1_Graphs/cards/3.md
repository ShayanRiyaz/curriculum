##  Eulerian Paths and Eulerian Cycles

A **path** in a graph is a sequence of vertices that are connected by edges. It's a specific route you take when traversing the graph.

A **cycle** in a graph is a path that starts and ends at the same vertex.

A graph is Eulerian if it has a Eulerian cycle and semi-Eulerian if it has a Eulerian path. 

A **Eulerian path** visits every edge only once, but can revisit the vertices. You may start from one vertex and end the path with another.

A **Eulerian cycle** is a Eulerian path that starts and ends at the same vertex.

Note that not all graphs have Eulerian paths or cycles.

 The **degree** of a vertex is the number of edges that are incident to the vertex.

Euler found that graphs can have **Eulerian cycles** if and only if all vertices have even degrees.

If two vertices have odd degrees and all other vertices have even degrees, then the graphs have a **Eulerian path**.



 Example of a **Eulerian Path**:

The graph has a **Eulerian path**, but no **Eulerian cycle** .  Note that the `A  ` and `C`  have odd degrees.



 Example of a **Eulerian Cycle**:

This is an example of a **Eulerian cycle**. All the vertices have an even degree. Follow the path `C` `A` `B` `C` `D` `E` `C`.
