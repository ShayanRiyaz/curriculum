## Hamiltonian Paths and Hamiltonian Cycles

Instead of focusing on edges, we are going to focus on vertices.

A **Hamiltonian path** visits every vertex once.

A **Hamiltonian cycle** is a Hamiltonian path that begins and ends at the same vertex.



**KÃ¶nigsberg Bridge Problem**

There are seven bridges in the city. We want to know if it's possible to cross all the seven bridges once and walk through the whole city. 

In order to solve the problem, the map is turned into a graph. Each piece of land or island is represented as a vertex, and each bridge is represented as an edge connecting the vertices.

There is no Hamiltonian path because there are too many vertices with odd edges. In order to visit all the bridges, people have to revisit the land or island.

Another example of a graph that doesn't have a **Hamiltonian path**:

Note that there are two vertices `A` `B`  with odd degrees.

Example of a **Hamiltonian Path**:

This graph has the **Hamiltonian path** `A` `B` `C` `D` `E` `B`, but it doesn't have a **Hamiltonian cycle**. 



Example of a **Hamiltonian Cycle**:   

You can choose whatever vertex you want and follow the same direction until you return to the first vertex.
