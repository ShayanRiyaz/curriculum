## Keys and Rooms
### Time to solve a coding problem using a graph!

Keys and Rooms is a delightful puzzle that can be solved with a graph. The problem goes as follows:

There are N rooms and you start in room ```0```.  
Each room has a distinct number in ```0, 1, 2, ..., N-1```, and each room may have some key(s) to access other room(s). 

Formally, each **room** ```i``` has a list of keys ```rooms[i]```, and each **key** ```rooms[i][j]``` is an integer in ```[0, 1, ..., N-1]```.  A key ```rooms[i][j] = v``` opens the room with number ```v```.

Initially, all the rooms start locked (except for room ```0```, which is where you begin). 

You can walk back and forth between rooms freely.

**Return true if and only if you can enter every room.**

### Examples
**Example 1:**
Input: ```[[1], [2], [3], []]```
Output: ```True``` because each of the rooms can be visited.

**Example 2:**
Input: ```[[2,3], [1], [0], [2,0]]```
Output: ```False``` because there is no way to enter Room 1.

### Starter Code
Here is some starter code for you:
```python
def canVisitRooms(rooms):
  # should return True/False
  
```
