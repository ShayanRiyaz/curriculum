## Keys and Rooms
### Time to solve a coding problem using a graph!

Keys and Rooms is a delightful puzzle that can be solved with a graph. The problem goes as follows:

**There are N rooms and you start in room ```0```.  Each room has a distinct number in ```0, 1, 2, ..., N-1```, and each room may have some key(s) to access other room(s). 

Formally, each room ```i``` has a list of keys ```rooms[i]```, and each key ```rooms[i][j]``` is an integer in ```[0, 1, ..., N-1]```.  A key ```rooms[i][j] = v``` opens the room with number ```v```.

Initially, all the rooms start locked (except for room 0, which is where you begin). 

You can walk back and forth between rooms freely.

Return true if and only if you can enter every room.**
