## Keys and Rooms
### Full Solution

```python
def dfs(visited, graph, node):
  if node not in visited:
    visited.add(node)
    for neighbour in graph[node]:
      dfs(visited, graph, neighbour)

  return visited

# essentially check if we can hit every vertex in the graph
def canVisitRooms(rooms):

  # 1. create adjacency list from rooms
  graph = {i:[] for i in range(len(rooms))}
  for j in range(len(rooms)):
    graph[j] = [key for key in rooms[j]]

  # 2. dfs traverse the adjacency list
  rooms_reached = dfs(set(), graph, 0)

  # 3. return True of False
  if list(rooms_reached) == list(range(0, len(rooms))): return True
  else: return False

print(canVisitRooms([[1,3],[0],[1],[2]]))
```
