This code is used to test our BFS algorithm.   

```python
g = Graph() 
g.addEdge(0, 1) 
g.addEdge(0, 2) 
g.addEdge(1, 2) 
g.addEdge(2, 0) 
g.addEdge(2, 3) 
g.addEdge(3, 3) 

print ("Following is Breadth First Traversal"
				" (starting from vertex 2)") 
g.BFS(2) 
```

We first construct an empty Graph object.

```python
g = Graph()
```

We then add edges between our vertices as we build our graph.

```python
g.addEdge(0, 1) 
g.addEdge(0, 2) 
g.addEdge(1, 2) 
g.addEdge(2, 0) 
g.addEdge(2, 3) 
g.addEdge(3, 3)
```

Finally, we call our BFS function on our graph and print out the order the vertices were visited in!

```python
print ("Following is Breadth First Traversal"
				" (starting from vertex 2)") 
g.BFS(2)
```

How is the BFS internally implemented? 

The first step in implementing the BFS algorithm is to create a Graph class.

```python
from collections import defaultdict
class Graph: 

	def __init__(self): 		
		self.graph = defaultdict(list)
```

Naturally, a `Graph` object should have an `addEdge` function so that vertices can be connected to one another. The function takes the two vertices of the graph that you wish to connect (`u` and `v`) as arguments. `self.graph[u].append(v)` takes the vertex `u` and adds (through `append`) the vertex `v` to the list of adjacent vertices to `u`, signifying that the graph has an edge from `u` and ending at `v`! 

```python
def addEdge(self,u,v): 
	self.graph[u].append(v)  
```

The `BFS` function takes the vertex from which we are to start our search (`s`) as an argument. Here is the code for the BFS algorithm. 

Let's break each step down:

```python
def BFS(self, s): 
  visited = [False] * (len(self.graph)) 
  queue = [] 
  queue.append(s) 
  visited[s] = True
  while queue:  
			s = queue.pop(0) 
			print (s, end = " ")
      for i in self.graph[s]: 
				if visited[i] == False: 
					queue.append(i) 
					visited[i] = True
```

`visited` is an array that keeps track of vertices that have already been visited (marked `True` when visited). We initialize this to `False` for every vertex, as at the start of the algorithm, no vertices have been visited yet.

```python
visited = [False] * (len(self.graph)) 
```

We need a queue (recall the First-In, First-Out rule) for the order in which the vertices are visited. Since no vertices have been visited yet, we initialize the queue to be empty.

``` python
queue = []
```

Before we go in depth with the algorithm, skim this diagram. As you read the implementation details, continue to refer back to this diagram to check your understanding.

To begin the search, we insert the start node (`s`) into the queue and mark `s` as "visited: by changing `visited[s]` to `True`.

```python
queue.append(s) 
visited[s] = True
```

Now, the fun begins! This algorithm will terminate only when the queue is empty, as this signifies that all nodes of the graph have been visited. This is why the `while` loop condition reads `while queue` (i.e., run the body of the loop while the queue still has an element in it). Once again, don't fret, we will break down each line!

```python
		while queue:  
			s = queue.pop(0) 
			print (s, end = " ") 	
```

The first step of the `while` loop is to dequeue the first element.

```python
s = queue.pop(0)
```

Initially, we only pushed the start node (argument `s`) into the queue. At this point, it will be removed and stored in `s`, which now serves as a temporary variable for storing the last popped vertex.

We then print the element to the console. The order that the elements will be printed to the console in indicate the order in which they were visited in the BFS algorithm.

```python
print (s, end = " ") 
```

Now, we must check which of the adjacent vertices of `s` (the last vertex popped from the queue) have been visited. If the adjacent vertices have not been visited, we add them to our queue and mark them as such. This is done throughout the following `for` loop.

```python
			for i in self.graph[s]: 
				if visited[i] == False: 
					queue.append(i) 
					visited[i] = True
```

 The `for` loop header runs for every vertex adjacent to (i.e., has an edge to) the last vertex popped from the queue (`s`).

```python
for i in self.graph[s]:
```

In the body of the for-loop, `i` represents the current adjacent vertex (to `s`) we are observing. We then refer to the `visited` array and check if the vertex has already been visited.

```python
if visited[i] == False: 
```

 If `i` has already been visited (`visited[i] == True`), we should return to the top of the `for` loop and continue the algorithm with the next vertex adjacent to `s`. However, if the element has not been visited (`visited[i] == False`), we have to perform additional work to ensure the element is recognized as "visited."

First, we must add `i` to the queue. This is so we can process the neighbors of `i` when we pop it off the queue later in the algorithm. 

```python
queue.append(i)
```

 We also must change the value of `i` in `visited` to `True` so that for the rest of the algorithm, it is evident that this vertex has been visited.

```python
visited[i] = True
```

After all adjacent vertices of `s` are processed in the `for` loop, we jump back to the top of the `while` loop and check for remaining vertices in the queue (`while queue`). If the queue is empty, the algorithm terminates, as we have visited (and printed to the console) all the vertices in BFS order. Otherwise, we pop the first element from the queue and repeat the procedure until all vertices have been visited.
