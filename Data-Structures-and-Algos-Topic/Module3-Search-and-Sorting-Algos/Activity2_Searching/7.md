DFS and BFS are two sides of the same coin. This means they have the same goal of traversing a graph, but the way they traverse is different. However, despite the difference in their ways, the time complexities for both are the same: O(V + E) for an adjacent list and O(V^2) for an adjacency matrix. 

To explain this, we will have to delve into the code of DFS: 

```Python
def DFSUtil(self, v, visited): 
		visited[v] = True
		print(v, end = ' ')
    for i in self.graph[v]: 
			if visited[i] == False: 
				self.DFSUtil(i, visited) 
        
  def DFS(self, v): 
		visited = [False] * (len(self.graph)) 
		self.DFSUtil(v, visited)   
```

###What is the time complexity?

Just like in our BFS algorithm, the for-loop runs in O(n) time, where n is supposed to be the number of edges of the graph. However, unlike in our BFS algorithm, there is no while-loop to iterate over every vertex inside the graph. Therefore, where does the V come from in the O(V + E) stated above?

The while-loop is actually hidden in the code above. Instead of looping through the vertices using a while-loop, the code recurses. In other words, it calls itself n times for each vertex inside the graph we are traversing, thus hiding the while-loop. This can be seen in the last line of the `DFSUtil` function:

```python
if visited[i] == False: 
				self.DFSUtil(i, visited)
```

Therefore, the recursion occurs in O(n) time, where n is the number of vertices in the graph. Thus, when we combine the time complexities for recursion and the for-loop, we get O(V + E) again. 

### Adjacency List vs. Adjacency Matrix

We will get the same time complexity we got for BFS for the adjacency list and adjacency matrix implementation of DFS. The reason for that is the same as for BFS. If you were to use an adjacency matrix, then you'd have to iterate V^2 times. But, in an adjacency list, you'd only have to do it V + E times. Thus, the adjacency list is O(V + E) and the adjacency matrix is O(V^2).
