<!--title={Matchsticks to Square: Complexity Analysis}-->

Let's find out how efficient our `makespare()` function is and what its space and time complexities are:

**Complexity Analysis**:

- **Time Complexity**: O(4^N) 

  We have a total of N matchsticks. For each matchstick, we have four different possibilities for the subset each might belong to or the side of the square each might be a part of.

- **Space Complexity**: O(N)

  For recursive solutions, the space complexity is the stack space occupied by all the recursive calls. The deepest recursive call would be of size N, so the space complexity is O(N). There is no additional space other than the recursion stack in this solution.
