<!--title={Big O of BFS}-->

As a reminder, the Big O notation describes the execution time required of or space used by an algorithm or code in computer science. Therefore, since BFS is an algorithm, its Big O can describe its run time speed. We will start with the code from the previous card: 

```python
def BFS(self, s): 
  visited = [False] * (len(self.graph)) 
  queue = [] 
  queue.append(s) 
  visited[s] = True
  while queue:  
	s = queue.pop(0) 
	print (s, end = " ")
        for i in self.graph[s]: 
          if visited[i] == False: 
            queue.append(i) 
            visited[i] = True
```

As you might have noticed, there is a while-loop in the BFS algorithm.

 ```python
while queue:
 ```

This while-loop is going through every vertex inside the graph. Therefore, the Big O for this part of the algorithm is O(n). That is because the while-loop will loop n times, where n is the size of the queue list being iterated over. 

The next significant part of the BFS algorithm that affects its time complexity is the for-loop after the print statement. 

```python
for i in self.graph[s]:
```

This for-loop is visiting the adjacent vertices of the current vertex as stated previously.  Therefore it is going through every edge present in the graph. Just like the while-loop before, the time complexity of this part of the algorithm will be O(n), where n is the size of the graph list.

###Combining Time Complexities

Now, when you combine the two, you would get O(n^2), as the for-loop is inside the while-loop. The algorithm loops n times because of the while-loop. Inside each while-loop, you must iterate another n times due to the for-loop, thus yielding the result of O(n^2). However, that is an inaccurate time complexity for BFS!

We got O(n) for the while-loop because it is going through every vertex inside the graph, and an O(n) for the for-loop because it is going through every edge in the graph. However, the number of vertices and edges are NOT the same. Therefore, a more accurate Big O for the algorithm is O(V +E), where V is the number of vertices being iterated over in the while-loop, and E is the number of edges being iterated over by the for-loop. This is unfortunately not fully accurate, as it will depend on the data structure being used in the BFS implementation.

### Adjacency List vs Adjacency Matrix

Depending on if you use an adjacency list or an adjacent matrix, the time complexity of the BFS will change. But before we get into that, it is best to describe what the two data structures are.

 An adjacency list is a collection of unordered lists, where each list is a neighbor to another. This data structure is used for sparse graphs. A sparse graph is one where the number of edges is small, making the graph "sparse."

An adjacency matrix specifies which nodes in a graph are connected to each other. This data structure is used for dense graphs. A dense graph contains a large number of edges, making the graph "dense."

Thus, if you use an adjacency list to implement BFS, then you will get a time complexity of O(V + E) and O(V^2) if you were to use an adjacency matrix. For an adjacency matrix, you will have to iterate over a matrix V^2 times, but in an adjacency list, it is just V+E times due to the list only consisting of nodes.
