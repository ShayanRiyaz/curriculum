# Steps

## 1-1 Step 1

### Name

```
**Step 1: Have a conceptual understanding of directed graphs**
```

### md_content

```
As per the activity, directed graphs are represented through their node and edges. Within a file system, each file or folder is a node and each "parent" folder has an edge connecting it to its child folder/file.
```

## 1-1 Step 2

### Name

```
**Step 2: Understand how to find a parent/child relationship from structural numbers**
```

### md_content

```
The parent/child relationship can be found through reading and performing some manipulations on the "structural" number provided. The entire number is mapped to the name of the folder on its right, but the first few numbers correlate to the parent folders.

Make sure to understand the hierarchy of the folders before moving on.
