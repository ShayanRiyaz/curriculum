# File System 

# Long Summary

Students will have to parse through a file containing information about a folder/file's "structural position" within its structure and name. After extracting any information relevant to directed graphs, they will store it in a graph that they implement themselves. Students will use the networkx library to help them visualize the graph with a GUI. Then, they will write the ordered file structure to an output file using DFS.
# Short Summary

Students will understand graphs better by implementing a directed graph representing a small file structure and printing its ordered structure in a file.

# Criteria

- The edges in these graphs have directions. What objects in the file system are the "from" objects and the "to" objects. Why?

- Is a graph useful if it only contains a list of nodes? Why or why not?

- When performing a DFS, what is the significance of using a queue?
