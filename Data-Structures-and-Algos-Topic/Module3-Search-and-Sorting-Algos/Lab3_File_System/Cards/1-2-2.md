# Steps

## 1-2-2 Step 1

### name

```
**Step 1: Store the edges of the directed graph** 
```

### md_content

```
Now that we have isolated the folder numbers, we will have to figure out how to organize our edges, maintaining our numbering hierarchy.

To find and store the edges for later use, we can slice the structural number string down everything but the last character. Notice how this newly sliced string is the structural number string of the current folder's parent. We are going to represent each individual edge as a tuple and edges as a list. Here we make one edge, store it as a tuple, and add it to the list:
```

### code_snippet

```python
	aTuple = (dirAndVal[0][:-1], dirAndVal[0])
	edges.append(aTuple)
```

### md_content

```
The first parameter of `aTuple` is the structural number of the the current folder's parent and the second parameter is the structural number of the current folder itself. `aTuple` represents an edge from parent to child. 
```

## 1-2-2 Step 2

### name

```
**Step 2: Handle edge cases** 
```

### md_content

```
Remember to check to check your **edge cases**!
```

### code_snippet

```python
		if (dirAndVal[0] != "0"):
```

### md_content

```
Why is the above good for handling an edge case? What is that edge case? I'll give you a hint: its purpose lies in the following line. 
```

### code_snippet

```python
aTuple = (dirAndVal[0][:-1], dirAndVal[0])
```

### md_content

```
Here, we are forming a tuple whose first element represents a parent and whose second element represents its child. We do this by extracting the last number in the structural number in order to clearly see the parent number. For example, the following shows how to store the edge from the parent of `dirAndVal[0] = 0123` to `0123` itself.

* `dirAndVal[0][:-1]` would return `012`, the parent structural number
* `dirAndVal[0]` would return `0123`, the child structural number

`aTuple` would then be `(012, 0123)`.

Now, once again, let's return to why our edge case check is necessary. If we are processing the root, (represented by `0`)

* `dirAndVal[0][:-1]` would return nothing
* `dirAndVal[0]` would return `0`

Our `aTuple` would be confusing, as the first element would be empty! Thus, since the root is a special exception (it has no parent), we do not want to create an `aTuple` where `0` is the child (second parameter of `aTuple`) structural number.
