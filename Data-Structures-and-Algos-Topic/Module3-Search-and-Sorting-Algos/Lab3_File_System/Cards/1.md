We will be representing a simple file structure with a directed graph. You will receive a text file to use as a reference. The file will contain a bunch of file and folder names written in the format: `###. some words`. Each node inputted within the graph will always have some relation to the original parent node to represent connnections between each node. 

The following is an example of a file you could receive:

```
0. Friends
01. Season 1
011. Seinfeld
012. The Big Bang Theory
013. Cheers
02. Season 2
021. Parks and Recreation
022. How I Met Your Mother
...
```

The following numbers represent the "level" of the folder/file. Such numbers include `0` being the root folder and `01` being a subfolder of `0`, and so on. 

- In the example above, `0. Friends` would be the root, while `01. Season 1` would be its subfolder. With `0` being the initial folder of our file, each subfolder has some relationship with the original folder. In this case, we can see here that `0` is the root folder for the show `Friends`. 
- Based off of this, the `01. Season 1` would be the subfolder recommending shows similar in viewership and content to `0. Friends`. This explains why roots `011 to 013` are connected to `0. Friends`. 
- The same could be said for the `02. Season 2` subfolder containing shows similar to the second season of `0. Friends`. This example will create a recommendation system form in which they'd recommend seasons of shows that are very similar to the seasons of the root folder in the file.
  - You can assume that the level or the number of folders/files per level will never surpass `9`
  - You can assume that the root will always be `0`
- `some words` represents the "name" of the folder/file, similar to how you would name your folders

In the first part of the program, you will be required to:

* Parse the file to obtain the structural numbers *and* names of the folders/files 

In later stages of the lab, you will:

* Find a way to represent these components in a directed graph
* Display the graph using `networkx` and redirect the output to a file 


This lab serves to illustrate a practical application of directed graphs from start to finish. Upon completing this lab, you should learn about situations in which one would choose a directed graph as their data structure implementation.
