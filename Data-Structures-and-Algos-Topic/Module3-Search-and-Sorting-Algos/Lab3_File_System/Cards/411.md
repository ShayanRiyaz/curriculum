Let's review `DFS` as a concept before we dive into its application to this specific problem. `DFS` is an algorithm that traverses a graph (directed or undirected) through the use of a data structure called a `stack` (Last-In, First-Out). We begin with a given start node, mark it as "visited," and push its unvisited neighbors to the stack. We then pop the top node off of the stack, mark it as "visited," and repeat this process until all nodes have been visited. 

It's important to have a fundamental understanding of `DFS` to complete this part of the lab. If needed, you can refer back to the activities which discuss `DFS` in depth (no pun intended).

Let's get to the specifics of this problem now.

You need to create a `visited`  `defaultdict(bool)`. We have to use a `defaultdict` because we need to index our `visited` by the string that identifies a given node, which is `"011"`. 

```python
        visited = defaultdict(bool)
```

A `stack` must be created since it will hold the nodes to be visited next. Unlike a `queue`, it will enable us to print out our "folders" in the correct relative order:

```python
		stack = []
```

Why does a `stack` do this? It is because this problem wants us to list the folders in an order such that we go as "far" down the tree as possible before going back up when we can't go further. That is, we wish to print `0` , then its first child `01` , then its children `011`, `012`, and `013` before we print `0`'s second child, `02` (refer to the diagram below).

Notice how we're going as far down the tree as possible by popping from the **top** of stack. The stack allows us to do this as we can add all the unprinted, neighboring folders of the folder we just printed, pop the **top** of the stack and print that folder, and repeat this process until all folders are printed.

Now, back to the code.    

Since we want to begin with `start`, we need to push it onto our stack:

```python
		stack.append(start)
```

And since we are pushing `start` onto our stack, that means we will have already visited it, so we need to mark it as such:

```python
		visited[start] = True
```
