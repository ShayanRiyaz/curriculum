Here is a diagram of the file structure with the root, subfolder, and so on. Make sure to study the file structure before moving on to the coding details.

Let's get into the implementation.

First, we have to open and read the file line by line to read every folder and its associated number:

```python
readFile = open("textOutline.txt", "r")
for line in readFile:
```

To separate the names from the numbers, we'd have to split the line between the number and words. In order to do that, we can use the built-in `split()` function. However, that still leaves extra space before the name, so we will use the `strip()` function. Store these two parts in a list, named `dirAndVal` here:

```python
	dirAndVal = line.split(". ")
	dirAndVal[1] = dirAndVal[1].strip()
```

To find and store the edges for later use, we can slice the structural string down to everything but the last character. Notice how this newly sliced string is the structural character of the current one's parent. We are going to represent each individual edge as a tuple and all edges as a list. Here, we make one edge, store it as a tuple, and add it to the list:

```python
	aTuple = (dirAndVal[0][:-1], dirAndVal[0])
	edges.append(aTuple)
```

Remember to check your **edge cases**!

```python
	if(dirAndVal[0] != "0"):
```

Why is the example above good for handling edge case? What is that edge case? I'll give you a hint: its purpose lies in the following line.

```python
aTuple = (dirAndVal[0][:-1], dirAndVal[0])
```

Here, we are forming a tuple whose first element represents a parent and whose second represents its child. We do this by separating the last number in the directory number from the rest of it in order to clearly see the parent number. For example, 0123 ` is a subfolder of ` 012`. Thus,

* `dirAndVal[0][:-1]` would return `012`, the parent (subfolder) number
* `dirAndVal[0]` would return `0123`, the child number

`aTuple` would then be `(012, 0123)`.

Now, once again, let's return to why our edge case check is necessary. If we are processing the root, (represented by `0`)

* `dirAndVal[0][:-1]` would return nothing
* `dirAndVal[0]` would return `0`

Our `aTuple` would be confusing, as the first element would be empty! Thus, since the root is a special exception (it has no parent), we do not want to create `aTuple` for it.
