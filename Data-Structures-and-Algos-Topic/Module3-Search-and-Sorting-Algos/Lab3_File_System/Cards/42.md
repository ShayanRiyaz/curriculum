This part of the traversal is where the actual *traversing* happens. 

You are going to want to continually do the following operations until your `stack` is empty:

1. Obtain a new `start`
2. Write the information associated with that `start` to the output file
3. Sort the list of edges connecting to `start`
4. Check all edges from the given `start ` and put them on the `stack` to go there
