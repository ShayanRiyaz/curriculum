# Steps

## 1-3 Step 1

### name

```
**Step 1: Understand how to store information in a graph node conceptually**
```

### md_content

```
So far, we have only focused on understanding the numbering scheme of the folders. How will we account for the fact that each number has an associated name? How will we store this information when reading the file?

We can store the names of each of these files as the **value** of a node, each **node** being the unique structural number associated with each name. Recall in the activity that we can map the values to the nodes after defining the edges.

Assume that you will never have to add edges to undefined nodes.
```

## 1-3 Step 2

### name

```
**Step 2: Understand how to store values in a directed graph programmatically**
```

### md_content

```
In the activity, a dictionary was used to pass in the values to the directed graph; you should do the same.

This will be the last step in completing the function related to reading in and storing the file's information. Once you have completed this function, you should call it from the `main` function.
