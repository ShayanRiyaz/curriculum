# Steps

## 2-1 Step 1

### name

```
**Step 1: Understand the "from" and "to" nodes of an edge**
```

### md_content

```
To write your `Graph` class well, it should be really easy to insert edges into the graph. Each edge has a "from" and a "to" node represented by a 2-dimensional **tuple**. Because the edges are directed, the order of the elements in the tuple matters!

Now would be a great time to contemplate how the "from-to" relationship is represented in the input file. Use that information to contemplate the direction of your arrows and how to best store information in the tuple.

## 2-1 Step 2

```
**Step 2: Create a graph constructor**
```

### md_content

```
Now, in order to create the graph, we must have a `Graph` **constructor** to initialize any **attributes** a `Graph` may have. Those attributes would be the nodes and edges since they are the foundation of forming a graph in the first place. 

Let's first focus on adding the edges attribute and the associated function. If we want to add elements into the edges attribute, we should write a method adding them one by one.
