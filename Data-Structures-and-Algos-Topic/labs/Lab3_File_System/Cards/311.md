As explained earlier, we need to take this extra step because the `networkx` library does not have a preset layout representing the graph as a tree. 

Luckily, we provided you with a manual implementation of this layout in the `hierarchy_pos()` functions. 

Here, we are calling `hierarchy_pos()` with our graph, `G`, as an argument, as well as the string `"0"`. We do this because we want to tell the function that it will deal with the layout of our graph `G`. The `"0"` tells the graph that `"0" ` is the identity of the root node.

```python
    pos = hierarchy_pos(G,"0")
```
