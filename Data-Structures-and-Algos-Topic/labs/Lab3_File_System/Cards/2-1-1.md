# steps

## 2-1-1 Step 1

### name

```
Initialize a graph
```

### md_content

```
Let's get into the implementation details of how to create our constructor and `addEdge` function.

To add edges to a graph, we first have to initialize a graph.
```

### code_snippet

```python
G = Graph()
```

## 2-1-1 Step 2

### name

```
Create a `Graph` constructor
```

### md_content

```
To be able to create a new `Graph` object, we have to have a `Graph` **constructor**, in which we initialize any **attributes** it may have. In our case, the edges and the values of the nodes are the most important, so we are going to store them as attributes.

For now, we are focusing on the edges, but keep in mind that we will need value of the nodes (`val_map`) later.
```

### code_snippet

```python
def __init__(self):
	self.edges = defaultdict(list)
	self.val_map = {}
```

## 2-1-1 Step 3

### name

```
Create an `addEdge` function
```

### md_content

```
To add elements into the edges attribute, we should write a method which adds the edges one by one. Since it is a directed graph, we should accept a `from_node` and a `to_node`.

`from_node` is the node at the "tail" of the edge and `to_node` is the node at the "head" of the edge. Essentially, in `addEdge`, we are forming an edge starting at `from_node` and ending at `to_node` by storing `to_node` in the adjacency list of `from_node` (`self.edges[from_node]` is a list representing all the nodes that `from_node` has edges to).

It should now make sense *why* properly determining which node is `from_node` and which node is `to_node` affects arrow direction and our algorithm correctness. The arrows of our directed graph start at `from_node` (parent node) and go towards `to_node` (child node). If we flipped this in our code and had `from_node` point to `to_node`, we would get incorrect results, as we would have our child folder be the parent of our parent folder! 
```

### code_snippet

```python
def add_edge(self, from_node, to_node):
	self.edges[from_node].append(to_node)
```

## 2-1-1 Step 4

### name

```
Adding edges to the graph
```

### md_content

```
From the previous code, we should have constructed a list of edges from the file as we were reading it in, storing the parent as the tuple's first element and its child as the tuple's second element. But since our function only adds one edge at a time, we have to add the edge as we iterate through the graph.
```

### code_snippet

```python
for edge in edges:
  G.add_edge(*edge)
```
