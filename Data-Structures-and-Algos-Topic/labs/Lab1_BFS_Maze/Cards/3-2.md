**Step 1: Check If Each Neighbor Has Been Visited**

Now that we have a list of neighboring spaces, we have to check if each of them have been visited or not. We must do this because if a neighboring space has already been visited, then we don't want our BFS to process it again.

(Allowing the BFS to process the same node twice in the above example could result in node G never being processed.)

**Step 2: Creating A List Of Non-Visited Neighbors**

Initialize another list to be the **non-visited** neighbors. 

For each neighboring space, if the neighboring space is <u>not a wall and has not been visited yet</u>, then add this neighbor to the list of non-visited neighbors. 

Remember that asterisks (*) represent walls in the maze. 

Then, return this list.
