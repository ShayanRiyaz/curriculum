**Step 1: Initializing Data Structures**

To begin, what data structures will you need to initialize for BFS? Remember, a BFS is a "breadth-first search," which means every space surrounding the current space should be searched before any other spaces in the maze. There are two data structures we need: one for keeping track of the coordinates to be searched and one for the coordinates already visited.

Reminder: You can generate the available neighboring spaces with the `getAdjacentSpaces()` method. This will be useful to determine which coordinates to search for in each iteration.
