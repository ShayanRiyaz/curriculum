Please reference the starter code for details on `BFS()` and how it is used in `main()`. 

For the final part of our code, implement a BFS search algorithm for this problem that views all the paths until the shortest path is found.

- Keep in mind that you will have to do some code maneuvering in the first iteration of your while-loop because tuples are an `immutable` data structure in Python (i.e., tuples cannot be changed after being created).
- Take a second to think about which coordinate pair the search should start on.
