**Step 1: Visualizing The Maze**

To help you visualize what the maze will look like as a 2D array, consult the following image:

**Step 2: Recognizing Coordinate Points As Tuples**

As you can see, elements of a 2D array can be represented by coordinate points. For example, in this image, the coordinate point (2,2) refers to element C2 in the array. These coordinate points can be represented as tuples in Python.

**Step 3: Generating A List Of Neighbors**

In order to return a list of non-visited neighbors, we first need to generate all neighbors. Each space will only have four neighbors in the north, south, west, and east directions. Keep track of a list of coordinates (tuples) that are their neighbors in a list. 

**Hint:** Think of how we can find the index of neighbors in relation to the index of the space.
