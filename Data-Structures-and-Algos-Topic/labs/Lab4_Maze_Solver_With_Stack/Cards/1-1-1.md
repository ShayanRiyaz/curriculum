## 1-1-1 Step 1

### name
Define the constructor

### md_content

Define `__init__` as the following:

```python
self.index = -1
self.arr = [None] * ROWS * COLUMNS
```

In order to repersent each location we need to specify it's rows and columns. A 2D array allow us to do this as it will keep track of both information.

Here, we have a maze map which has 30 rows and 100 columns. So, we are creating  a 2D array that is 30 by 100.

Note : ROWS and COLUMNS are defined as global variables.

```python
ROWS = 30
COLUMNS = 100
```

## 1-1-1 Step 2

### name
Define `push` as the following

### md_content

```python
self.index = self.index +1
self.arr[self.index] = a
```
