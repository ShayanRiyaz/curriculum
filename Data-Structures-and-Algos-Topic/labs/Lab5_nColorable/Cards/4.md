Since we have created our adjacency matrix and a colors list, the next step is to create the function that does the coloring of the vertices, the `graphColoring()` function. You may want to call other functions within `graphColoring()`  to make your code more readable. You can use **DFS** to inspect the vertices of the graph and **Backtracking Search** to make the process quicker in some cases.
