# nextMove()

Similar to the first clause in our `nextMove()` function, we will be checking every square within our `grid`  for the third clause. However, this clause is our fallback to use in conjunction with another function called `testPossible()` which we have not yet defined. 

Thus, I will further provide hints for this guessing clause in our `nextMove()` function:

- One nested for-loop to iterate through all squares.

- Using the resulting list return from `findPossible()`, you will need to use a for-loop to iterate through each index in that resulting list and apply further logic to check each square, including `testPossible()`.

- The `testPossible()` function accepts six arguments:

  - `grid`
  - `r_i`
  - `c_i`
  - `i`
  - `depth + 1`
  - `finish`
