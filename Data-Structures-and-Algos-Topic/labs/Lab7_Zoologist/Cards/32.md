Each iteration, we designate an element as the **key** called `arr[j]` (each element gets to be the **key** starting from the leftmost element to the rightmost element).

Within each iteration, for each element starting from the second element (since the first iteration's key is the first element and we don't have to compare the first element with itself), we shift all the previous elements greater than the key (`arr[j]`) one position forward in the array. These are the intermittent shifts; do not print these out. Instead, you want to print out the result after these intermittent shifts finish per element.
