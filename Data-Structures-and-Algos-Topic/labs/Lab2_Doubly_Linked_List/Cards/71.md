**Step 1: Visualize It**

For this card, we highly recommend you to grab a piece of paper and a pencil with you to visualize the reversing process. Doing this will make things more clear as you follow along and draw the list for every move.

First, in the **reverse()**, check whether your list is empty. If the list is not empty, it is safe to reverse. Then, figure out which variables you need and what to assign them to in order to reverse your list. 

Here are a few hints and questions that could help you out:

If your current node is labelled as **curr**, the previous node of **curr** will become the following node of **curr**, and vice versa. What information should you store at this point? What will you need to complete this process? After that, your **curr** should move to the previous node, and this reversing process will repeat. When you reach the end of this reversing process, what will the value of **curr** become?

Now, with these hints in mind, try drawing out a graph by yourself to visualize this process, and then start building your function!
