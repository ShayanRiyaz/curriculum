**Step 1: Looping Through the List**

Now, let's starting coding the actual reversing process.

To move through the entire list, we will create a while-loop, which will iterate through each node and halt when `curr` reaches the end of the list. For instance, if we were at the second node in a list of five, we would set `temp` as a pointer to first node, then switch the second node's pointers, which are in the first to third line under the while-loop.

The final step in the while loop is very interesting! You would think that we would want `curr = curr.next`, but remember that we just swapped the `next` and`prev` pointers. Instead, we would set `curr = curr.prev`. Now, `prev` is now pointing in the direction of `next`.

```python
    # Swap next and prev for all nodes of  
    # doubly linked list 
    while curr is not None: 
        temp = curr.prev  
        curr.prev = curr.next
        curr.next = temp 
        curr = curr.prev
```
**Step 2: Checking for Edge Cases**

Before we finish coding our reverse() function, we need to check for certain cases.

If the list is either empty or only has one node, then the reversing process is not needed or will not work because there is nothing left to be reversed! So, we need to make sure to check for these cases before proceeding.

```python
	# Before changing head, check for the cases like  
	# empty list and list with only one node 
	if temp is not None: 
    	self.head = temp.prev 
```
With that, your reverse() function is complete! 

```python
def reverse(self): 
    temp = None
    curr = self.head
    self.tail = curr
    
	# Swap next and prev for all nodes of  
    # doubly linked list 
    while curr is not None: 
        temp = curr.prev  
        curr.prev = curr.next
        curr.next = temp 
        curr = curr.prev
        	
	# Before changing head, check for the cases like  
	# empty list and list with only one node 
		if temp is not None: 
		self.head = temp.prev 
```
