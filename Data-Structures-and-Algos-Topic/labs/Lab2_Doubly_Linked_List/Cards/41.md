Define a function called **push()**. This function will take a value as the parameter. Inside this function, you need to check whether the list is empty. (Hint: Check the status of the head node.)

Recall the member variable in your **DoublyLinkedList** class. How do you extract the member variable to return the length of your doubly linked list?
