You can traverse the list to get each element of the node and do something with it, either printing each element in the list or comparing it with a specific value.

Under your doubly linked list class, define a function called **printList()**. It should traverse the list and print each element separated by a comma. The function will take one parameter, which is the node you want to start printing from. It will print the list from this value to the end of the list. 

For edge cases, such as when the list is empty, your code may give an error. Try using an *if* statement to check for certain cases before going into the list traversal code.
