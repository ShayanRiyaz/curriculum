**Step 1: pushback()**

Define a function called **pushback()**, which will also take a value as the parameter to initialize the element of a new node. Of course, as you may have guessed, we need to check the empty list again! If the list is empty, simply make a new head node with the given value.

Same procedure here, check whether the list is empty. If yes, then simply return.

Otherwise, traverse the list to find the nodes that match the given value. If no node has the given value, then return the message, "Target not found." If you find a node with the given value, then remove that node from the list.
