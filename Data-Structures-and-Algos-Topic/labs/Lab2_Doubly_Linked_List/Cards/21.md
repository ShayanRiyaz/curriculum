**Step 1: printList()**

The simplest way to check an empty list is to see whether the first node exists. If the first node doesn't exist, meaning that the doubly linked list is empty, then you can return.

Otherwise, the list is not empty. If this is the case, set your current node from the head node to the tail node by using the next pointer.

Print the element of every node you go through.
