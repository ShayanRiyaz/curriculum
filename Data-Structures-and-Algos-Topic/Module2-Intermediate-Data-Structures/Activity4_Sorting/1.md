#### Python Sorting Algorithms

When a program takes in data, we need to have the data in some order before we can use it. Think of the last time you bought something online. You probably used different criteria to filter your search results, whether they were by price, rating, size, or other categories. 

Behind the scenes, a program puts each object in order depending on your desired criteria. This is where sorting comes in. When humans manually categorize something, such as a deck of cards, each person may choose to do so in a different style. Some may search for the aces, then the twos, and so on. Some may sort by suit first. While there is no wrong way to reach a sorted sequence, efficiency differs between methods.

Similarly, in Python, when we want to sort data from an input file, there are different systematic **algorithms** that we can use to create an ordered list. 

Though there isn't a single algorithm considered the most optimal in every circumstance, we will go over four of the most classic sorting algorithms: 

- Bubble sort
- Merge sort
- Insertion sort
- Quick sort
