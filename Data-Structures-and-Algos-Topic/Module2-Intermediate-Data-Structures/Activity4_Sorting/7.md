The insertion sort algorithm's time complexity is slightly different than the bubble sort's. But before heading into that, here is the code for it as reference:

```Python
def insertionSort(arr): 
    for i in range(1, len(arr)): 
        key = arr[i] 
        j = i-1
        while j >= 0 and key < arr[j]:
        	arr[j+1] = arr[j]
        	j -= 1
        arr[j + 1] = key
```



### Insertion Sort Time Complexity

Unlike with bubble sort, the insertion sort only has one time complexity for all its cases. Regardless of whether or not the list's order has been fully sorted, partially sorted, or reversed, the time complexity remains as O(n^2). This can be seen in the two loops present in the code:

```Python
for i in range(1, len(arr)): 
        key = arr[i] 
        j = i-1
        while j >= 0 and key < arr[j]:
```

As you may have noticed, the two for-loops ALWAYS trigger regardless of the state of the list. It only stops once all elements in the list have been visited by the first for-loop. But, every time the first for-loop lands on an element, the while-loop will traverse the list again to check if anything else needs to be sorted. Therefore, due to the two loops, the time complexity for all cases is O(n^2).
