# Bubble Sort Theory

Bubble sort is considered to be one of the simplest sorting algorithms. The name comes from the fact that this method compares two adjacent elements and swaps them if they're out of order. This makes larger values "bubble to the top" (to the end of the list), resulting in a fully sorted list.

Lets break this process down into steps using the list shown above:

1. Compare the first two numbers; if they are not sorted (as in the larger number comes before the smaller one), then swap the two. This assumes that you want the list elements to be sorted from smallest to largest. In our list, 6 comes before 5, so we swap the two. The list now looks like this:

2. Move on from the first value and compare the second and third. Swap if necessary. In our case, 6 now comes before 3, so we swap again:

3. Continue down the list until you reach the last element. At this point, the largest value has been sorted. In our example, 8 is the largest number. So, 8 should now be last in the list:

4. We finished the first pass of the list. Now, we start over again from the first number, 5 in our case, and repeat Steps 1-3. This time, however, we continue down the list to the *second-to-last* element. This is because 8 is where we want it, so swapping is unnecessary. We then repeat the whole process until we arrive at our desired fully sorted list:
