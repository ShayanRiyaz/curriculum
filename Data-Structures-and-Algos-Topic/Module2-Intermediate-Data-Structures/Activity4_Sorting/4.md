Before we explain the various time complexities of bubble sort, here is the code for the algorithm:

```python
def bubbleSort(bubble):
   for n in range(len(bubble)-1,0,-1):
    for i in range(n):
           if bubble[i] > bubble[i+1]:
               temp = bubble[i]
               bubble[i] = bubble[i+1]
               bubble[i+1] = temp
```

###Best Case

The best-case scenario when doing bubble sort occurs when the list given to you is already sorted. In that case, the best-case time complexity is O(n). That can be seen in the nested for-loop:

```python
for n in range(len(bubble)-1,0,-1):
    for i in range(n):
      if bubble[i] > bubble[i+1]:
```

At this point, the algorithm checks if the current list is sorted. If it is not sorted, then the elements get swapped. In the best-case scenario, since the list is already sorted, the algorithm will only go through all elements once, thus giving us a best-case time complexity of O(n).

### Worst-Case Scenario

The worst-case scenario occurs when the list is reversed. If that is the case, the worst-case time complexity is O(n^2). That can be seen in the two for-loops:

```Python
for n in range(len(bubble)-1,0,-1):
    for i in range(n):
      if bubble[i] > bubble[i+1]:
```

Because the list is reversed, while the first for-loop goes through every element once, the second for-loop will be doing the same thing again to swap the elements in the reversed list. Since one for-loop takes O(n) time, a nested for-loop like this will take O(n^2) time. Therefore, the worst time complexity of the bubble sort is O(n^2). 

###Average Case

The likelihood of the list being either sorted or reversed is very small. However, the time complexity of the average case is O(n^2), just like in the worst-case scenario. Even though the list is partly sorted, there will still be action in the two for-loops to ensure swapping occurs to fully sort the list. Of the three cases, this is the most likely scenario to happen.
