**Step 1: popBack()**

Let's look at how to pop a node from the **back** with the`popBack()` function. 

To access from the **tail** of the list, we will use `self.tail` since it points to the very last node. Also, using the same procedure we had in `popFront()`, we will check if the list is empty. If it is, we can write `return` since there are no nodes to pop.

```python
def popBack(self):
    
    # 1. If the list isn't empty
    if self.head == None:
      	return
```
