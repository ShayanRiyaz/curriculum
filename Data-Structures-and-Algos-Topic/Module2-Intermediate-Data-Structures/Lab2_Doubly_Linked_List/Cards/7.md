Let's reverse the list, because why not?

Let's define a function called **reverse()** that reverses the order of your current list so that the head becomes the tail and vice versa.

For example, if you have a list like this:

[head: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> 6 -> tail: 7]

The new list after being reversed will be this:

[head:7 -> 6 -> 5 -> 4 -> 3 -> 2 -> tail: 1]

You should traverse the new list and print out each element for verification.

Make sure to check if your current doubly linked list is empty. In that case, there are no elements to be reversed, so just return.
