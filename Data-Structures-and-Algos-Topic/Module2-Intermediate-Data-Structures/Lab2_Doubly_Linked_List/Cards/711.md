**Step 1: Coding the Swap**

Let's start building our `reverse()` function by creating variables. We can first make a copy to the head node and label it as `curr`, then set the tail node to `curr` in order to start from the beginning of the list. During the reversing process, we will need to establish another variable `temp` with a value `None` that will be used to swap the nodes around `curr`.

```python
def reverse(self): 
    temp = None
    curr = self.head
    self.tail = curr
```

Note that the order in which the variables are set matters because the variable `curr` needs to created and assigned before setting the tail node to `curr`. Always be careful when establishing variables in your functions.
