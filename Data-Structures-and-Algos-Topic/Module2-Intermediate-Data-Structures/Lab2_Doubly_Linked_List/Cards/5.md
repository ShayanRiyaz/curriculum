Similar to insertion, there are also multiple ways to delete elements from a doubly linked list, which are the same as introduced in the previous card. Check out the description and implement these functions in your doubly linked list class.

**Deleting Elements From the Start**

- Define a function called **popFront()**, which does not take in any parameter.
  - If the list is empty, return.
  - Otherwise, delete the head node.

**Deleting Elements From the End**

- Define a function called **popFront()**, which also takes no parameter.
  - If the list is empty, return.
  - Otherwise, delete the tail node.

**Deleting Elements by Value**

Write a function called **pop()**. In this method, you need to think carefully since several cases need handling in order to remove an element by value.

- Continuing from the **push()** function, if the list is not empty, it should insert the new node as the head of the list.

**Inserting Items at the End**

- The function **pushback()** will check if this is an empty list.

- If not an empty list, insert the new node as the tail of the list.


**Inserting Item After Another Item**

- Define a function called **insertAfter()**, which will take two parameters: the value of the new node and the node to be inserted after.

- Check if the list is empty because you don't want to "insert" after an empty list. 

- If it's not an empty list, but the selected node to be inserted is not found, print the message, "Target not found."

- If the node exists in the list, insert the new node after the selected node.


**Inserting Item Before Another Item**

- Define a function called **insertBefore()** which will take two parameters for the value of the new node and the node to be inserted after.
- Check the empty list.
- If it's not an empty list, but the selected node to be inserted is not found, print the message, "Target not found."
- If the node exists in the list, insert the new node before the selected node.
