Since you have been introduced to the concept of a linked list, we are going to make a doubly linked list in this lab. Different from a singly linked list, a **D**oubly **L**inked **L**ist (DLL) contains an extra pointer called the previous pointer, together with the next pointer and the data (the components already in a singly linked list).

With an extra pointer (previous pointer), a doubly linked list can be traversed in both forward and backward direction. It also helps us to insert a new node or delete a node because singly linked list needs the previous pointer to operate deletion.

With the brief introduction to the doubly linked list, let's start this lab by making a **Node class** to initialize a new node with the element and the next and previous pointers.

Next, we need to create the **DoublyLinkedList class** that contains different functions related to doubly linked lists. Remember that we don't use arrays here, we use pointers to the next and previous nodes in order to access and adjust elements in the list. 

At the beginning, we have no nodes in our current linked list, so we should have a constructor that initialize the head pointer as None. After that, we will implement different functions in this class to manipulate our linked list.
