**Step 1: pop()**

For our next function, `pop()`, we will be able to delete any existing node we want from the list.

Starting from the beginning of the list, we will use `self.head` since it points to the first node. Using the same procedure we had in `popFront()` and `popBack()`, we will check if the list is empty. If it is, we can just write `return` since there are no nodes to pop.

```python
def pop(self, target):
    
    # 1. Check if the list is empty
    if self.head == None:
      	return
```
