**Step 1: pushback()**

Define a function called **pushback()**, which also takes a value as the parameter to initialize the element of a new node. Of course, as you may have guessed, we need to check the empty list again! If the list is empty, simply make a new head node with the given value.

If this list already contains some elements, we need to traverse through the list until we reach the tail pointer. The next pointer of the tail will be `None`; this is the base case to stop your while-loop at. 

As you come to the last node of the list, simply apply the logic as you insert a new node at the front. However, we are inserting at the end, so the pointers adjustment will be a bit different.
