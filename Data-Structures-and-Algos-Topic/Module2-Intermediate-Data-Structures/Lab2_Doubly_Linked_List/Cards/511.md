**Step 1: popFront()**

Now that we know how to add nodes to the list, let's learn how to *remove* nodes from the list.

First, let's remove from the **head** of the list. We will rely on `self.head` since it points to the first node in the list.

This function will be called `popFront()`.

```python
def popFront(self):
  
  	# 1. If the list is not empty
  	if self.head == None:
				return
      
    else:
    		# 2. If there ISN'T only one node
    		if self.head.next != None:
      			self.head = self.head.next
      			self.head.prev = None

      	# 3. If there's only one node
      	else:
            self.head = None
            self.tail = None
    
		# Decrement size
    self.size -= 1
```

For `popFront()`, we will check if the list is empty, then check if there is more than one node in the list and set `self.head` to the next node. Now that `self.head` is the <u>second</u> node in the list, we can now get rid of the connection to the previous node. If there is only one node in the list, just make the head and tail point to `None`.
