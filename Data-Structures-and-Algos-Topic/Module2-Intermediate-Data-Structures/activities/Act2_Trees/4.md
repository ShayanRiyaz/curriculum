Now that we understand the basic structure of a **Binary Search Tree**, let's start building some useful functions that will allow us to access and manipulate our trees.

#### BST Search:

If you know the key to a specific node in a BST and want to access it within your BST, build a function called `BSTSearch`; this function will allow you to do so.

```Python
def BSTSearch(curNode, key):
    if curNode is None or curNode.key == key:
        return curNode
    if curNode.key < key:
        return BSTSearch(curNode.right, key) #Go right
    else:
        return search(curNode.left, key) #Go left
```

The `BSTSearch` function behaves like how you would if you were looking for a specific key in a BST: go right if you're looking for a larger key, or go left if you're looking for a smaller key. It starts at the root and calls the same function again on its right child if the desired key is greater than the current node's key. Or, it calls the same function again on its left child if the desired key is less than the current node's key. It eventually returns the current node being inspected if the node's key matches the desired key or returns null if it doesn't find a node with a desired key. Make sure you understand the code above before moving forward.

Let's see this in action using use the tree from the previous card as an example. Let's say we want to find `7` in our tree. Below, you can see the specific path that `BSTSearch` takes to look for the node:

##### Time Complexity:

Since we're interested in finding the asymptotic time in the **worst-case**, we must consider what the worst-case situation would be when searching for a node.

The diagram above depicts the worst-case scenario when searching for the node with key 50. As you can see, the time to reach a desired node would be O(height), and in this case, it would be **O(n)**, **n** being the amount of nodes in the tree.

`BSTSearch` **= O(n)**



###### How was this worst-case made? (under time complexity)

If you want to access a node with value of 50, you need to go from the root, move to the right child, and treat the child as a new node. You need to do it 5 times. The time complexity is O(n).
