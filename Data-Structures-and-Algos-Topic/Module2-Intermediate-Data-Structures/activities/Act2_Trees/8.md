Now that we know the basic concepts associated with trees, let's go through a real-life application of data trees to solidify our understanding.

As mentioned before, a place where a data tree occurs in your real life is with the relationships in your family. For the activity, we will make a data tree in Python using the `Node` class as a representation of a family.

#### Family Tree:

For our family tree, we want to hold the **name**, **age**, **gender**, and **favorite sport** for each member of the family. Therefore, we must slightly modify our `Node` class to encompass that data.

```Python
class Node:
    def __init__(self, name, age, gender, sport):
        self.key = name
        self.age = age
        self.gender = gender
        self.sport = sport
        self.children = []
    
    def insert_child(self, newChild):
        self.children.append(newChild)
```

We added arguments to the `Node` class initializer function that will let us store the important data for each family member. Notice that we are now assigning the name of the family member to be the key that we identify each node as. You could really use any data aspect as the key for each family member. It is just what we will use to identify a certain node.

##### Building the Tree:

Now that we have our new `Node` class, let's initialize some family members to start building the ancestry tree. For the **root** of the family tree, we want to use the grandmother of the family. Let's say the grandmother of the family's name is **Susan**, she is **92** years old, and her favorite sport is **bowling**. Let's initialize her `Node` object:

```Python
grandma = Node("Susan", 92, "female", "bowling")
```

Now that we have a node for Grandma Susan, let's say she has three children. Let's create some node objects for her children:

```Python
mary = Node("Mary", 57, "female", "soccer")
joe = Node("Joe", 61, "male", "football")
don = Node("Don", 63, "male", "tennis")
```

We have declared node objects for all of Susan's children but have not indicated in our code that they are her children yet. To do so, we can use the `insert_child` function in the `Node` class on Susan's object.

```Python
grandma.insert_child(mary)
grandma.insert_child(joe)
grandma.insert_child(don)
```

After making those 3 calls, "grandma.children" will now be a list that holds the node instances "mary," "joe," and "don." We have essentially drawn edges between "grandma" and "mary," "grandma" and "joe," and "grandma" and "don." 

Let's say that Joe got married and had two children. Although we could adjust our tree structure to include Joe's spouse, let's keep our tree simple for now and only show Grandma Susan's direct descendants. Let's create the `Node` instances for Joe's children:

```Python
ricky = Node("Ricky", 34, "male", "basketball")
kelly = Node("Kelly", 35, "female", "tennis")
```

Now, let's connect them to Joe's node with edges:

```Python
joe.insert_child(ricky)
joe.insert_child(kelly)
```

Now, we have successfully created a simple family tree using data trees in Python. For practice, try drawing the family tree we just created on paper. For more practice, try implementing your own family tree in Python by adding and deleting the new object nodes with family members.
