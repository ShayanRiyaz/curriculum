#  Starter code :

```
class Node:
    def __init__(self, data):
        self.left = None
        self.right = None
        self.data = data
        
def inorderTraversal(root):
```

Recall that inorder traversal visit the left subtree first, then the root and  the right subtree.

It's easy to slove the problem with recursion, think about how to translate the idea to a iterative solution. What are the differences?  When should you terminate? 

Hint : use stack
