Now that we understand the structure of a tree and the terminology used to describe its elements, let's think of how we would implement the structure in Python.

#### The `Node` Class:

It may be tempting to declare a class called `Tree` in which we store all the nodes in it. While this approach makes sense, it often leads to confusion and lacks built-in functionality for relationships between nodes in the tree. When you realize that a class for the tree itself is unnecessary, you may think of a second approach, which is the standard implementation. For this implementation, we will declare a class `Node` in which each instance of the class represents a node of the tree.  The `Node` class contains the data value of a node and a list of its children. Let's define the `Node` class:

```Python
class Node:
    def __init__(self, key):
        self.key = key
        self.children = []
    
    def insert_child(self, newChild):
        self.children.append(newChild)
```

This implementation of the `Node` class also includes an `insert_child` function that simply appends the node passed as an argument to the current node's list of children. Since each node has its children stored inside, the structure of the tree is maintained, making the `Tree` class unnecessary. You may be asking why we don't keep track of each node's parent. While this may be necessary for more advanced trees, it's unnecessary to implement a base tree that we're currently investigating.

#### Binary Trees:


A simple tree structure is fundamental, but let's investigate a specific type of tree that allows for an interesting, structured way to store data. A **Binary Tree **is a tree where every single node can only have zero, one, or two children.  The tree structure we will be dealing with, however, is a special kind of Binary Tree, the **Binary Search Tree (BST)**. **BST**s have a few more restrictions:

##### BST Rules:

* Every element in the left subtree of a node has keys that are *lesser* in value than the key of that particular node.

* Every element in the right subtree of a node has keys that are *greater* in value than the key of that particular node.

  

  Let's see an example of a valid vs. invalid BST:

  â€‹        <img src="../images/2-1.png">                                      <img src="../images/2-2.png" width="250">

  

Are you able to tell which tree is a valid or invalid BST?

The **left** tree is an **invalid** BST because the node containing the key `10` is in a right subtree of the node containing the key `30`. You may have noticed that all subtrees of a BST are also BSTs.



In order to implement a BST in Python, we need to adjust our previous `Node` class:

```Python
class Node:
    def __init__(self, key):
        self.left = None
        self.right = None
        self.key = key
```

Since we know BST nodes only have two children max, we no longer need a list to store the children. We simply store the left child as the **left** element and the right child as the **right** element. In the `Node` class, the left and right children are initialized to null.
