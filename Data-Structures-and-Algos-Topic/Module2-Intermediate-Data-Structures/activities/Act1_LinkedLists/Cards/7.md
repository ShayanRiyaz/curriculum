Now that we have our linked list implementation, we can put it to work! Assume we work at a film production company and we're holding auditions! The auditions begin at 9:00 in the morning.

```python
film = LinkedList()
film.head = Node(900)
```

>  Note: This is the code from the 2nd card! Remember that when initialized, the first node of the linked list will be the head node.

Now that we've initialized our linked list with a head node, we will continue to build onto it for the duration of our film audition appointments. 
Each succeeding node will represent another scheduled audition, each 30 minutes apart.

One way we could do this is by creating a new node and setting it as the next node following the previous node:

```python
node1 = Node(930)
node2 = Node(1000)
film.head.set_next(node1)
node1.set_next(node2)
```

> Note: *node1* and *node2* are new nodes that represent two more scheduled auditions for our linked list *film* that follow the head node. 

Since the first node in our linked list is the head, we then call `film.head.set_next(node1)` in order to assign `node1` as the next node following it. 
 Now that `node1` is the tail of our linked list `film`, we call `node1.set_next(node2)` in order to assign `node2` as the next node following it.

Another way we could add a new node to our *film* linked list is by simply using the *insert()* function. Assume we got extra appointments for auditions up until lunchtime.

```python 
film.insert(1030)
film.insert(1100)
film.insert(1130)
film.insert(1200)
film.insert(1230)
```

> Note: The `insert()` function defined in the *LinkedList* class is capable of creating a new node with the designated data you pass. It will assign the new node as the next one in your linked list (it only will append the node to the END, or tail). 

Now, we should have a linked list that contains a total of 8 nodes representing 8 audition appointments in succession. We can verify the number of nodes by using the *size()* function:

```python
print(film.size())
```

Assume someone canceled their audition for 10:00 AM. Afterwards, a different person cancels their 12:30 PM appointment. (Maybe this means an earlier lunch!) To make sure their appointments are no longer in the system, we can use the `delete()` function defined in the *LinkedList* class:

```python
film.delete(1000)
film.delete(1230)
```

> Note: The *film* linked list will retain its order of nodes after deletion of the specified ones.

To confirm that the canceled appointments were removed, we will check that the corresponding nodes were deleted from our linked list by searching for them:

```python
print(film.search(1000))
print(film.search(1230))
```

> Note: The first `search()` function looking for the data point of 10:00 should return an error stating the data was not found (since the node has been deleted). The same should happen for the 12:30 node.

To double check, we can use the *size()* function to identify that `film` now only contains 6 nodes in this order: 9:00, 9:30, 10:30, 11:00, 11:30, 12:00.

If we were to search for an existing appointment, we can do so in a similar fashion:

```python
print(film.search(930))
```

> Note: The output produced will show the address in memory where the node is stored in our linked list *film*.

If we want to access the data in the node associated with 9:30 in `film`:

```python
print(film.search(930).get_data())
```
> Note: This outputs the data at the particular node we searched for opposed to the address of the node as in the prior example.
