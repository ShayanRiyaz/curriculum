Now that you have the files for both the animals and the equations, you can see which animal belongs to each equation through their end behavior and assign a rank to each of them based on growth rate value. End behavior is the behavior of the functions' graphs as they approach large values (also known as their **time complexity** or **Big O**).

Once you have matched each equation to an animal, you will know the order of the equations from smallest to largest. Use this knowledge and create an array of numbers representing the descending order of magnitude in which the equations were given. If you have equation values `[10, 156, 20, 2]`, then create an array of `[3, 1, 2, 4]`, since:


* `10` is the third largest number, so its rank is `3`
* `156` is the largest number, so its rank is `1`
* `20` is the second largest number, so its rank is `2`
* `2` is the smallest number, so its rank is `4`

Since this array of numbers maps with the animal names, use the dictionary and **print** out the order of animals linked to the order of equations given to confirm you stored them correctly. The order of animals printed out should match the order of the equations in the given data file.

We want to sort this `array` using three different sort methods: **Bubble Sort**, **Insertion Sort**, and **Selection Sort** (as per lab policy D). Edit the print statements given in the starter code to accept the `array` as an **input** and **print** out each step of a **swap** or moving of the components.
