<!--title={Use of Graphs}-->

Graphs provide us with very useful data structures that can help us to find relationships and connections within our data. With the advent of Machine learning and big data, we need to get as much information as possible about our data, and learning a little bit of graph theory can certainly help us with that.

Here is a visual example of a graph:

Graphs are widely used by many companies and online platforms that we may use in everyday life. Facebook, for instance, uses graph theory to run the friend suggestion algorithm to link users together. In this case, users are seen the vertices of the graph representing a user's friend network, and the edges between users indicate that they are friends. 

To suggest a friend, the algorithm would traverse through these graphs to see if there are any mutual interests and friends shared between users, and if there are, Facebook would suggest these two users to send friend requests to one another.
