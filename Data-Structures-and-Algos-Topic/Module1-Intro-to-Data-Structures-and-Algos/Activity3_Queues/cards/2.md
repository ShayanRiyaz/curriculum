### Implementing a queue

When implementing a queue, here are a couple points to remember:

1. The points of entry and exit are different in a Queue.
2. Enqueue is a function of a Queue data structure used to add an element to a Queue.
3. Dequeue is a function of a Queue data structure used to remove an element from a Queue.
4. The front of a Queue is the element of the Queue that was first enqueued.
5. The rear of a Queue is the element of the Queue that was last enqueued. 
6. Random access is not allowed - you cannot add or remove an element from the middle.

Keep these facts and definitions in mind as we go through the implementations of a Queue.

We are going to see two different implementations. One is using Lists and another is using the library *dequeue*. Letâ€™s take a look one by one...

> Remember, Queues operate in FIFO (first in, first out) order
