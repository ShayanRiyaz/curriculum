Let's take a look at an example problem to demonstrate a use for queues (credit to https://leetcode.com/problems/shortest-subarray-with-sum-at-least-k/ for the problem statement).

 Return the **length** of the shortest, non-empty, contiguous subarray of `A` with sum at least `K`.

 If there is no non-empty subarray with sum at least `K`, return `-1`.
**Example 1:**
```
Input: A = [1], K = 1
Output: 1
```
**Example 2:**
```
Input: A = [1,2], K = 4
Output: -1
```
**Example 3:**
```
Input: A = [2,-1,2], K = 3
Output: 3
```
The function header should be defined as follows.
```python
def shortestSubarray(A, K):
```
