# steps

## 4-3-1 Step 1

### name
```
Check if the North Tile is Blank
```

### md_content
```
Using North as an example:

```python
maze[curr_row - 1][curr_col] == 32
```
```

## 4-3-1 Step 2

### name
```
Check if it is the direction where we just came from
```

### md_content
```
```python
(curr_row - 1) != rowStack.top()
```
```

## 4-3-1 Step 3

### name
```
Check if it is a Dead End
```

### md_content
```
inArray(rowVisited, colVisited, ROWS*COLUMNS, curr_row - 1, curr_col)
```

## 4-3-1 Step 4

### name
```
Put them together
```

### md_content
```
```python
if ((maze[curr_row - 1][curr_col] == 32) and ((curr_row - 1) != rowStack.top()) and not inArray(rowVisited, colVisited, ROWS*COLUMNS, curr_row - 1, curr_col)):
```
```

## 4-3-1 Step 5

### name
```
Update Location
```

### md_content
```
If the tile pass all the if statement then we have to update our location index as well as `rowStack` and `colStack`, which keep track of where we have been.

	rowStack.push(curr_row)
	curr_row = curr_row - 1
	columnStack.push(curr_col)
Do this for all the directions:

```python
if #up
elif #down
elif #left
elif #right
```
```
