# steps 

## 1-2-1 Step 1

### name
```
Implementing the Pop Function
```

### md_content
```
Define `pop` as the following:

```python
self.index = self.index - 1
return self.arr[self.index + 1]
```
```

 Decrements the index, and returns the one that was deleted.

We don't have to actually erase the value,  because the only time when index will increment again is `push`. At `push` we will write over the old value with a new value.
```

## 1-2-1 Step 2

### name
```
Implementing the Top Function
```

### md_content
```
Define `top` as the following:

```python
return self.arr[self.index]
```
```
