# steps

## 3-1-1 Step 1

### name
```
Use the os Module
```

## md_content
```
Import `os` and use `os.system` to set color of the grid if you will of your choice.

```python
os.system("color 3")
```
```

## 3-1-1 Step 2

### name
```
Use a for Loop to Print the Grid
```
### md_content
```
Write a for loop to print grid. 

```python
for r in range(0, ROWS):
	for c in range(0, COLUMNS):
		print(chr(grid[r][c]),end="")
    print(" ")
```

Note that we only have a newline at the end of row. Python defaults to print a new line with every print statement. So make sure that for every item in a row we are ending with "".
