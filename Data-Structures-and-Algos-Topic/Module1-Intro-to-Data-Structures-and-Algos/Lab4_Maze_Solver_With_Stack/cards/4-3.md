# steps

## 4-3 Step 1
 
### name
```
Decide which Direction to go in
```

### md_content
```
Check surrounding tiles to see where could we go next. 

There should be three conditions that we should check for:

1. if the tile is blank
2. if the tile was not most previously visited
3. if the path of the point did not already lead to a dead end.

Only when the tile satisfied these three conditions, should we set foot on it.

Recall that we have two stacks: `rowStack` and `columnStack` to keep track of the paths that we have taken to get to our current location.
```

## 4-3 Step 2

### name
```
Update Variables
```

### md_content
```
Once we decide to set foot into the next tile, we should push our current location to `rowStack` and `columnStack`, and updates our location index, curr_row and curr_col.
