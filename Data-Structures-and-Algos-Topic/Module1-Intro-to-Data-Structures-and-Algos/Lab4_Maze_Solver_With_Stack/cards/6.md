Now, we have all the puzzle pieces that we need, let's put together our solver neatly in main by calling `loadFile`, `printGrid`, and `solveMaze`.

After the maze solver find the exit, let's print out Done!:) from `done.txt`. Load the file by calling `loadFile(doneFile)`, and `printGrid(done)`.

When you are done, get yourself some ice-cream.

Congratulations! You have written a Maze Solver using Stack!~
