## Interview Question: 

 ## Calculate the Space Complexity of the following 

 ```python
 # n is the length of array arr[]
 def sum(arr, n):
 	#4 bytes for x
 	x = 0
   # 4 bytes for i
 	for i in range(0,n):
 	    x  = x + arr[i]		
 			return x
 ```

 For calculating the space complexity, we need to know the value of memory used by different type of datatype variables, which generally varies for different operating systems, but the method for calculating the space complexity remains the same.

 | Type                                                   | Size    |
 | :----------------------------------------------------- | :------ |
 | bool, char, unsigned char, signed char, __int8         | 1 byte  |
 | __int16, short, unsigned short, wchar_t, __wchar_t     | 2 bytes |
 | float, __int32, int, unsigned int, long, unsigned long | 4 bytes |
 | double, __int64, long double, long long                | 8 bytes |



 - In the above code, `4*n` bytes of space is required for the array `a[]` elements.
 - 4 bytes each for `x`, `n`, `i` and the return value.

 Hence the total memory requirement will be `(4n + 12)`, which is increasing linearly with the increase in the input value `n`, hence it is called as **Linear Space Complexity.**

 Similarly, we can have quadratic and other complex space complexity as well, as the complexity of an algorithm increases.
