**Lets look at another familiar function, `listInList`**

```python
keypad = [[1, 2, 3], 
          [4, 5, 6],
          [7, 8, 9],
          [0]] 

def listInList(keypad):
    sum = 0
    for row in keypad:
        for i in row:
            sum += i
    return sum
```

We work with two numbers, `i` and `sum`. These require **c1** and **c2** amount of memory. 

Each element in `keypad` will require **c3** amount of memory. We can conclude that the array `keypad` requires **c1 * n^2** amount of memory. 

The Space(Input) equation for `keypad` looks something like this. 


> Space(Input) = c1 + c2 + c3*n^2

Our equation represented by the dominant term would be **c3 * n^2** 

## Optimize Time or Optimize Memory?

The greater the input of a function, the greater amount of time and memory that the function will require to operate. A common question is **"Is it better to have our function run faster, but require more space; or should we have our function require less space, but run slower?"**

We can either have our function run faster, but require more memory or our function run slower, but require less memory.

The general answer is to have our function run faster. It is always possible to buy more space/memory. It's impossible to buy extra time. Hence, the general rule is to **prioritize** having our function/algorithm run faster.
