**Hash tables** are a type of data structure in which the address or the index value of the data element is generated from a hash function. A **hash function** is any function that can be used to map data of arbitrary size to fixed-size values. The values returned by a hash function are called **hash values**. The values are used to index a fixed-size table which is the Hash table. Use of a hash function to index a hash table is called **hashing**.

That makes accessing the data faster than can be done with many other data structures. For example, accessing data in Linked Lists could potentially take much longer, as one would have to loop through the list until the desired data is acquired. If you wished to find the last element in the list, you would have to go through the *entire* list! In Hash Tables, on the other hand, the index value behaves as a key for the data value. In other words, a Hash table stores key-value pairs but the key is generated through a hashing function and this key can be used to access the element.

Thus, the search and insertion functions of a data element (which rely on accessing data) become much faster as the key values themselves become the index of the array, which stores the data.

To further your understanding of hashtables, let's give a realistic example on how they work. Let's say you're at an ice skating rink. When you go ice skating and you swap your shoes for ice skates. They take your shoes, put them in the ice skates box that includes your size, and give you the ice skates and a token which has the size (hash) and the shoe pair number (element in the hash box).
