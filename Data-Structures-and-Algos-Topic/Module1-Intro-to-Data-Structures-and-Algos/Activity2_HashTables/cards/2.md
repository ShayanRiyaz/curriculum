**Hashing** is a technique that is used to uniquely identify a specific object from a group of similar objects. Some examples of how hashing is used in our lives include:

- In universities, each student is assigned a unique roll number that can be used to retrieve information about them.

- In libraries, each book is assigned a unique number that can be used to determine information about the book, such as its exact position in the library or the users it has been issued to etc.

In both these examples the students and books were hashed to a unique number.

Assume that you have an object and you want to assign a key to it to make searching easy. To store the key/value pair, you can use a simple array like a data structure where keys (integers) can be used directly as an index to store values. However, in cases where the keys are large and cannot be used directly as an index, you should use *hashing*.

To truly appreciate hashing, one must have a basic understanding of Big-O notation and time complexity of algorithms, which you may have learned in the previous activity. Understanding Big-O notation allows one to know the worst-case time performance of certain algorithms or operations on a data structure, which can be important for a programmer in deciding which data structure to use. 

For our purposes, we will focus on **O(1)** time, which is Big-O notation for constant time. This means that the time that an algorithm takes to perform a certain procedure is **independent** of the size of the input.
