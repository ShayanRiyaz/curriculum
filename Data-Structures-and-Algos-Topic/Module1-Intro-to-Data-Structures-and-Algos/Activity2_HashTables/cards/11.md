### Double Hashing

Double hashing is similar to the other two collision menthods, the only difference being the interval between successive probes. Here, the interval between probes is computed by using two separate hash functions when there is a collision.

Let us say that the hashed index for an entry record is an index that is computed by one hashing function, but the slot at that index is already occupied. You must start traversing in a specific probing sequence to look for an unoccupied slot. The probing sequence will be:

index = (index + 1 * indexH) % hashTableSize;
index = (index + 2 * indexH) % hashTableSize;

and so onâ€¦

It uses one hash value as an index into the table and then repeatedly steps forward an interval until the desired value is located, an empty location is reached, or the entire table has been searched; but this interval is set by a second, independent hash function. Unlike the alternative collision-resolution methods of linear probing and quadratic probing, the interval is not fixed, and instead it depends on the data. Thus values mapping to the same location have different bucket sequences; this minimizes repeated collisions.
