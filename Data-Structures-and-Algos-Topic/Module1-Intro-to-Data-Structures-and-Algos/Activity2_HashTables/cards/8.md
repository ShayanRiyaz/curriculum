# Collision Methods

We're going to learn about methods we use to insert a value in our slot for the hash table by dividing (moduling) the index value by the hashtable size. This produces the remainder for the division, which is used as the index of insertion. Then finally, we will insert our index value to it's assigned slot. If that slot's full, we will look for available slots until the hash table gets full using different **collision methods**.
