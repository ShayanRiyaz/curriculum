In this card, we will exploring **separate chaining**. 
In **separate chaining**, each bucket is independent, and has a **list** of entries with the same index. In other words, it's a method by which lists of values are built in association with each location within the hash table when a collision occurs.

As each index key is built with a linked list, this means that the table's cells have linked lists governed by the same hash function. In place of the collision error in the figure from the last section, the cell now contains a linked list with the string 'Janet' and 'Martha' as seen in this new figure. We can see in this figure how the subsequent strings are loaded using the separate chaining technique.

### Advantages:
1) Simple to implement.
2) Hash table never fills up, we can always add more elements to the chain.
3) Less sensitive to the hash function or load factors. 
4) It is mostly used when it is unknown how many and how frequently keys may be inserted or deleted.

> A load factor is simply the ratio of entries in the hash table to the size of the array.

### Disadvantages:
1) Cache performance of chaining is not good as keys are stored using a linked list. Open addressing provides better cache performance as everything is stored in the same table.
2) Waste of space (some parts of the hash table are never used).
3) If the chain becomes long, then search time can become O(n) in the worst case.
4) Uses extra space for links.
