# Hash Tables in Python

As you now know, Hash tables are a type of data structure in which the address or the index value of the data element is generated from a hash function, allowing us to store key-value pairs with this index as the key. 

The search and insertion function of a data element becomes much faster as the key values themselves become the index of the array which stores the data, meaning we simply have to use the hash function to find the location of an element.

When we talk about **hash tables**, we can think of them as a type of **dictionary**. In Python, the Dictionary data type can be used for implementation of hash tables. The Keys in the dictionary satisfy the following requirements.

- The keys of the dictionary are hashable i.e. the are generated by hashing function which generates unique result for each unique value supplied to the hash function.
- The order of data elements in a dictionary is not fixed.

Thus the object type dictionary can be used to create a hash table. 
Dictionaries won't be covered extensively in this activity, but this an interesting piece of information to take note of.
