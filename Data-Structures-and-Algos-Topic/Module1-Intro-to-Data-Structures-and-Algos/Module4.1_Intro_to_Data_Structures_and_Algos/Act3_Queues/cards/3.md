# Deque Implementation

`deque` is a library which provides ready-made commands such as `append()` and `appendleft()` (**both** used for enqueuing elements) and  `pop()` and `popleft()` (**both** used for dequeuing elements). 

 Why are there two functions for enqueuing elements and two functions for dequeuing elements as well?  What advantage does this give us? This allows for us to use the `deque` library to create **double-ended** queues, meaning that insertions and deletions can occur at *either* end of the queue. In other words, we are allowed to add or delete elements from both the left and the right of the queue. See the following details about the different enqueuing and dequeuing functions:
 
 * `append(x)` - enqueues an element `x` to the **right** of the queue.
 * `appendleft(x)` - enqueues an element `x` to the **left** of the queue.
 * `pop()` - dequeues an element from the **right** of the queue.
 * `popleft()` -  dequeues an element from the **left** of the queue.
 

`remove()` is another useful function in the `dequeue` class. We can use `remove()` to remove a specific element from the queue, even if it is in the middle of the queue!

`Deque` has a lot of functionality and we should now learn to make use of them! 

1. First we have to import the collection! 
```python
from collections import deque
```


2. Now if we were to create a queue... 
```python
# Creating a Queue
queue = deque([1,5,8,9])
```


3. If we wanted to append items to our queue...
```python 
# Enqueuing elements to the Queue
queue.append(7) #[1,5,8,9,7]
queue.append(0) #[1,5,8,9,7,0]
```


4. If we wanted to deque elements...
```python

# Dequeuing elements from the Queue
queue.popleft() #[5,8,9,7,0]
queue.popleft() #[8,7,9,0]

```

5. If we wanted to display all our elements in the Queue...
```python 
#Printing the elements of the Queue
print(queue)
```

Try calling `popleft()` or `pop()` after the queue is empty and see what you get. Think about the ways in which you can handle this issue.
