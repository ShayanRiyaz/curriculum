#### Size of Stack

 Last, the only remaining function to accomplish our stack implementation is `size()` which simply just returns the size of our stack (how many elements are in the stack). 

 **One Parameter:** 

 *self :*   which refers to our stack objects 

 **Steps:**

 1. Use python `len` function to return the lenth of the list (which is defined as our stack).

 ```python
     #Getting the size of the stack
     def size(self):
         return len(self.stack)
 ```

 ### Class of Stack

 Here is our full implementation of `Stack` altogether:

 ```python
 class Stack:

     #Constructor creates a list
     def __init__(self):
         self.stack = list()
         
     #Adding elements to stack
     def push(self,data):
         self.stack.append(data)
         return True
       
     #Removing last element from the stack
     def pop(self):
         if len(self.stack)<=0:
             return ("Stack Empty!")
         return self.stack.pop()
       
     #Getting the size of the stack
     def size(self):
         return len(self.stack)
 ```

 > NOTE: Since the stack is represented by a list, the size of our stack size is dynamic which implies that we do not have concerns for increasing and decreasing our stack to whichever length of elements.
