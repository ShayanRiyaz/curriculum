### Class of Stack

Here is our full implementation of `Stack`:

```python
class Stack:

    #Constructor creates a list
    def __init__(self):
        self.stack = list()
        
    #Adding elements to stack
    def push(self,data):
        self.stack.append(data)
        return True
      
    #Removing last element from the stack
    def pop(self):
        if len(self.stack)<=0:
            return ("Stack Empty!")
        return self.stack.pop()
      
    #Getting the size of the stack
    def size(self):
        return len(self.stack)
```

> NOTE: Since the stack is represented by a list, our stack size is dynamic, implying that we do not have concerns for increasing and decreasing our stack to whatever length of elements.
