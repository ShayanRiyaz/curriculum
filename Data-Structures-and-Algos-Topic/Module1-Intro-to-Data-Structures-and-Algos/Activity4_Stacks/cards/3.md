### How to implement Stack?

 Now that you know what a Stack is, let's get started with the implementation!

 ### Stack implementation

 Here we are going to define a class Stack and add methods to perform the below operations:

 1. Push elements into a Stack
 2. Pop elements from a Stack and issue a warning if itâ€™s empty
 3. Get the size of the Stack
 4. Print all the elements of the Stack

 ###  Create Stack in Python

 Here we create our class `Stack` which will build our Stack with the attributes that comply to its structure. Within the class, we first will create the constructor which simply defines a `stack` object as a list.

 ```python
 class Stack:

     #Constructor creates a list
     def __init__(self):
         self.stack = list()
 ```
