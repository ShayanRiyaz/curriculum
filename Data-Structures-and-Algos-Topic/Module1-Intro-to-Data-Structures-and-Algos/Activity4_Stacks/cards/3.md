###  Create a stack in Python

Here, we create our class `Stack`, which build our stack with attributes that comply to its structure. Within the class, we will first create the constructor, which defines a `stack` object as a list.

```python
class Stack:

    #Constructor creates a list
    def __init__(self):
        self.stack = list()
```

---

#### Push elements (add elements)

Since our stack is just a list for now, we will now add the attributes that make it a stack. We still start off by defining the `push()` function, which adds elements into our stack. 

**Two Parameters:** 

*self:*   This refers to our stack objects. 

*data*: This is the data element you wish to add into the stack.

**Steps:**

1. Use Python's `append` function to add an element to the end of the list (the top of our stack) and return *True*. The `push()` function returns true to ensure that our item was added to the top (last index) of the stack.

```python
    #Adding elements to stack
    def push(self,data):
        self.stack.append(data)
        return True
```
