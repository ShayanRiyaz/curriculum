**Step 5)**

 Our goal now is to get the `avgDisk` on top of the `largeDisk` in the destination pole, but `smallDisk` is in the way so let's move that back to the source pole.

 ```python
 disk=auxPole.pop()
 sourcePole.push(disk)

 print(sourcePole.stack)
 print(auxPole.stack)
 print(destPole.stack)
 ```

 **Step 6)**

 The `avgDisk` is now free to be put on top of the `largeDisk` in the destination pole so we will do so now.

 ```python
 disk=auxPole.pop()
 destPole.push(disk)

 print(sourcePole.stack)
 print(auxPole.stack)
 print(destPole.stack)
 ```

 **Step 7)**

 Finally, we just need to put the `smallDisk` onto our destination pole and we will have completed our Tower of Hanoi puzzle!

 ```python
 disk=sourcePole.pop()
 destPole.push(disk)

 print(sourcePole.stack)
 print(auxPole.stack)
 print(destPole.stack)
 ```

 For a visual representation of the steps that we took to complete our Tower of Hanoi programatically,  you can take a look below:

 If you want to solve the tower of Hanoi in an automatic way, think about what kind of patterns you see in our example. Then, you can develop a recursive stack function to solve the problem. There are many ways you could do this. One possibly being a function that would take into account of the size of each disk on top of the stack, and would then pop each disk out of the original stack and onto another until it is solved.
