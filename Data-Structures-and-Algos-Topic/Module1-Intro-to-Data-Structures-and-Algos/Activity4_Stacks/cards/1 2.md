In this section, you will learn one of the most basic and useful data structure concepts known as a **stack**.

 A data structure **stack** is shown below:

> The above image is a **Stack Data Structure**. A stack is a **Last In First Out (LIFO)** data structure. It supports two basic operations called **push** and **pop**. The **push** operation *adds* an element to the **top of the stack**, and the **pop** operation *removes* an element from the **top of the stack**.

When you hear the word "stack," the first thing that comes to your mind may be a stack of books. We can use this analogy to explain stacks easily! Some similarities include:

1. There is a book at the top of the stack (if there is only one book in the stack, then that will be considered the topmost book).
2. Only when you remove the topmost book can you get access to the bottom ones. No Jenga games here! (Assume that you can only lift one book at a time).
3. Once you remove all the books from the top one by one, there will be none left and hence you cannot remove any more books.

Overall, the point of a stack is to ensure that the item that's placed highest (in our case placed last) has the most priority to be removed. The stack follows the concept of LIFO (Last In, First Out) in which the last item in our stack will be removed first.

**Things to remember:**

1. The entry and exit of elements happens only from the top of the stack. 
2. Push - Adding an element to the Stack (at the **top of the stack**).
3. Pop - Removing an element from the Stack (at the **top of the stack**).
4. Random access is not allowed - you cannot add or remove an element from the middle.

Note: **Always keep track of the Top.** This tells us the status of the stack.
