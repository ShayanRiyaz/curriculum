#### Initialize Stack

Using our `Stack` implementation, we can now use it as a data structure for storing and removing data elements. To begin using our stack, we need to initialize it as such:

```python
myStack = Stack()
```

#### Add elements

The variable `myStack` is now a stack object that is capable of using the functions we previously defined for our stack. Let's add some elements into our stack via `push()`, I will also print the operations in order for you to see that they have happened successfully since the function returns a boolean:

```python
myStack = Stack()
print(myStack.push(5)) #prints whether the operation "push" successes
print(myStack.stack)   #print the stack(left is bottom of the stack,right is the top of stack)
print(myStack.push(6)) 
print(myStack.stack)
print(myStack.push(9)) 
print(myStack.stack)
print(myStack.push(5)) 
print(myStack.stack)
print(myStack.push(3)) 
print(myStack.stack)
```
  
**result of the code :**

```python
True
[5]
True
[5, 6]
True
[5, 6, 9]
True
[5, 6, 9, 5]
True
[5, 6, 9, 5, 3]
```

Thus, our stack should now look as such: [5, 6, 9, 5, 3].

#### Return Size of Stack

If we check the size of our stack we can do so as such:

```python
print(myStack.size())   
```

**result of the code :**

and we see that the size of `myStack` is 5!
