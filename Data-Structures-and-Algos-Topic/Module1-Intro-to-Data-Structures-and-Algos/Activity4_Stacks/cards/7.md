#### Removing elements

Now we can proceed to remove the elements from our stack which is simply just calling `pop()` on `myStack`:

```python
print(myStack.pop())   #print the value of removed element
print("Current stack :",myStack.stack)   #print the stack now
print(myStack.pop())
print("Current stack :",myStack.stack)
print(myStack.pop())
print("Current stack :",myStack.stack)
print(myStack.pop())
print("Current stack :",myStack.stack)
print(myStack.pop())
print("Current stack :",myStack.stack)
print("the size of the stack now :",myStack.size())  #print the size of stack
print(myStack.pop())
```

**Result of the code:**
 
```python
3
Current stack : [5, 6, 9, 5]
5
Current stack : [5, 6, 9]
9
Current stack : [5, 6]
6
Current stack : [5]
5
Current stack : []
the size of the stack now : 0
Stack Empty!
```

Since `myStack` only contained 5 elements, the stack became empty after calling `pop()` five times as seen when we check the size again. Then upon calling `pop()` for the sixth time, we see that "Stack Empty!" is printed.
