#### Return Size of Stack

 If we check the size of our stack we can do so as such:

 ```python
 print(myStack.size())   
 ```

 **result of the code :**

 and we see that the size of `myStack` is 5!

 ---

 #### Remove elements

 Now we can proceed to remove the elements from our stack which is simply just calling `pop()` on `myStack`:

 ```python
 print(myStack.pop())   #print the value of removed element
 print("Current stack :",myStack.stack)   #print the stack now
 print(myStack.pop())
 print("Current stack :",myStack.stack)
 print(myStack.pop())
 print("Current stack :",myStack.stack)
 print(myStack.pop())
 print("Current stack :",myStack.stack)
 print(myStack.pop())
 print("Current stack :",myStack.stack)
 print("the size of the stack now :",myStack.size())  #print the size of stack
 print(myStack.pop())
 ```

 **result of the code :**

 ```python
 3
 Current stack : [5, 6, 9, 5]
 5
 Current stack : [5, 6, 9]
 9
 Current stack : [5, 6]
 6
 Current stack : [5]
 5
 Current stack : []
 the size of the stack now : 0
 Stack Empty!
 ```

 Since `myStack` only contained 5 elements, the stack became empty after calling `pop()` five times as seen when we check the size again. Then upon calling `pop()` for the sixth time, we see that "Stack Empty!" is printed.
