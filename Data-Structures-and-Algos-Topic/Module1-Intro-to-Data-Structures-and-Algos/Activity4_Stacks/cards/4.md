Now that we have the functionality to add to our stack, we must also have the ability to take elements out of our stack. Remember that stacks follow the **LIFO (last-in first-out)** order. This means the last element added in is the first element that gets removed. Our `pop()` function will be used to accomplish the removal of elements from our stack.

**One Parameter:** 

*self:*   This refers to our stack objects. 

**Steps:**

1. Check if the length of our stack is less than or equal to zero in order to confirm if it's empty or not. 
2. If it is empty, then we will return a print statement indicating so. 
3. Otherwise, we know it is not empty. Use Python's `pop()` function, which returns the last element of the list (the top of our stack), and remove it.

```python
    #Removing last element from the stack
    def pop(self):
        if len(self.stack)<=0:
            return ("Stack Empty!")
        return self.stack.pop()
```

#### Size of the Stack

Lastly, the only remaining function to accomplish our stack implementation is `size()`, which returns the size of our stack (how many elements are in the stack). 

**One Parameter:** 

*self:*   This refers to our stack objects. 

**Steps:**

Use Python's `len` function to return the length of the list (defined as our stack).

```python
    #Getting the size of the stack
    def size(self):
        return len(self.stack)
```
