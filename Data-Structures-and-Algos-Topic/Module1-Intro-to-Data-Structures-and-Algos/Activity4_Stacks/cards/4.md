### Application of the Stack — Tower of Hanoi

The Tower of Hanoi is a mathematical puzzle consisting of three poles and various sizes of disks that can slide onto any pole. The puzzle starts with the disks neatly stacked in ascending order of size on one pole, making a conical shape. The objective of the puzzle is to move all the disks from one pole ('source pole') to another pole (‘destination pole’) with the help of the third pole ('auxiliary pole').

The puzzle has the following **two rules**:

1. You can’t place a larger disk onto a smaller one.
2. Only one disk can be moved at a time.

With our stack implementation, we can go ahead and solve the Tower of Hanoi. Each pole (tower) will be represented by a stack. Each disk will be represented as a data element stored in the stack. 

**Assumption:**

3 disks and 3 poles (towers).  Below is a visual representation:

> Note: The left, middle, and right poles correspond respectively to the source, auxiliary, and destination.

Our objective is to move the stack of disks in the source pole to the destination pole in the exact same order without stacking a larger disk onto a smaller one. Implementing a stack helps rearrange the size of the disks depending on what was inserted latest in the pole and can be rearranged for other poles.
