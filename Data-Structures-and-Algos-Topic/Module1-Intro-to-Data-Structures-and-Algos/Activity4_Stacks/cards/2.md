### How do you implement a stack?

Now that you know what a Stack is, let's get started with the implementation!



### Stack Implementation

Here, we are going to define a class stack and add methods to perform the below operations:

1. Push elements into a stack.
2. Pop elements from a stack and issue a warning if itâ€™s empty.
3. Get the size of the stack.
4. Print all the elements of the stack.

###  Create a stack in Python

Here, we create our class `Stack`, which build our stack with attributes that comply to its structure. Within the class, we will first create the constructor, which defines a `stack` object as a list.

```python
class Stack:

    #Constructor creates a list
    def __init__(self):
        self.stack = list()
```

---

#### Push elements (add elements)

Since our stack is just a list for now, we will now add the attributes that make it a stack. We still start off by defining the `push()` function, which adds elements into our stack. 

**Two Parameters:** 

*self:*   This refers to our stack objects. 

*data*: This is the data element you wish to add into the stack.

**Steps:**

1. Use Python's `append` function to add an element to the end of the list (the top of our stack) and return *True*. The `push()` function returns true to ensure that our item was added to the top (last index) of the stack.

```python
    #Adding elements to stack
    def push(self,data):
        self.stack.append(data)
        return True
```

---

#### Pop the Element (Take the Element Out of the Stack)

Now that we have the functionality to add to our stack, we must also have the ability to take elements out of our stack. Remember that stacks follow the **LIFO (last-in first-out)** order. This means the last element added in is the first element that gets removed. Our `pop()` function will be used to accomplish the removal of elements from our stack.

**One Parameter:** 

*self:*   This refers to our stack objects. 

**Steps:**

1. Check if the length of our stack is less than or equal to zero in order to confirm if it's empty or not. 
2. If it is empty, then we will return a print statement indicating so. 
3. Otherwise, we know it is not empty. Use Python's `pop()` function, which returns the last element of the list (the top of our stack), and remove it.

```python
    #Removing last element from the stack
    def pop(self):
        if len(self.stack)<=0:
            return ("Stack Empty!")
        return self.stack.pop()
```

---

#### Size of the Stack

Lastly, the only remaining function to accomplish our stack implementation is `size()`, which returns the size of our stack (how many elements are in the stack). 

**One Parameter:** 

*self:*   This refers to our stack objects. 

**Steps:**

1. Use Python's `len` function to return the length of the list (defined as our stack).

```python
    #Getting the size of the stack
    def size(self):
        return len(self.stack)
```

---

### Class of Stack

Here is our full implementation of `Stack`:

```python
class Stack:

    #Constructor creates a list
    def __init__(self):
        self.stack = list()
        
    #Adding elements to stack
    def push(self,data):
        self.stack.append(data)
        return True
      
    #Removing last element from the stack
    def pop(self):
        if len(self.stack)<=0:
            return ("Stack Empty!")
        return self.stack.pop()
      
    #Getting the size of the stack
    def size(self):
        return len(self.stack)
```

> NOTE: Since the stack is represented by a list, our stack size is dynamic, implying that we do not have concerns for increasing and decreasing our stack to whatever length of elements.
