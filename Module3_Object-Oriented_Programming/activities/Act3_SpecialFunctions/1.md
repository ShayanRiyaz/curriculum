# Polymorphism

We already learned the power of inheritance, but there is another problem. Let's say we have a parent class and a few child classes that inherit from it. Sometimes we want to use methods from the parent class in the child classes too!

**Polymorphism** gives us the power to use methods from the parent class that are specifically created to be reused by child classes. 

For instance, let's say a `Shape` parent class have the following methods:

- `CalculateSurfaceArea()`
- `CalculatePerimeter()`

The `Triangle` , `Circle`, and `Rectangle` child classes will inherit from the `Shape` parent class. Since these shapes all have varying methods for calculating the surface area and perimeter, each of the child classes will implement their own versions of the `CalculateSurfaceArea()` and `CalculatePerimeter()`. 

If an instance of `Triangle` calls the `CalculateSurfaceArea()`, then `Triangle`'s `CalculateSurfaceArea()` will be called!
