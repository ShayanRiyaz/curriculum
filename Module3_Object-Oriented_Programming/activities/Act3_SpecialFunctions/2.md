# Activity: Sharks versus Clownfishes

Let's create a `Shark` class and a `Clownfish` class (note: this is separate from our previous `Fish` example with inheritance)! 

```python
class Shark():
    def swim(self):
        print("The shark is swimming.")

    def swim_backwards(self):
        print("The shark cannot swim backwards, but can sink    backwards.")

    def skeleton(self):
        print("The shark's skeleton is made of cartilage.")


class Clownfish():
    def swim(self):
        print("The clownfish is swimming.")

    def swim_backwards(self):
        print("The clownfish can swim backwards.")

    def skeleton(self):
        print("The clownfish's skeleton is made of bone.")
```

Both `Shark` and `Clownfish` classes have the same method names: `swim()`, `swim_backwards()`, and `skeleton()`. **Here is the catch: each of the respective methods print out different text.**

Let's instantiate these classes into two objects:

```python
sammy = Shark()
sammy.skeleton()

casey = Clownfish()
casey.skeleton()
```

Run the program and we see the following output:

```
The shark's skeleton is made of cartilage.
The clownfish's skeleton is made of bone.
```

Based on our output, we can see polymorphism in play! **Our complier is able to call the appropriate function based on the object type!**
