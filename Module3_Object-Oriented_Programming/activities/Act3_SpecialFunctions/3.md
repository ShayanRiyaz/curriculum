# Activity: Sharks versus Clownfishes (cont.)

Let's try something fun. Can we guess what will be outputted to our screen if we run this code?

```python
sammy = Shark()

casey = Clownfish()

for fish in (sammy, casey):
    fish.swim()
    fish.swim_backwards()
    fish.skeleton()
    print("\n")
```

In the code above, we instantiated two objects: `sammy` of `Shark` type and `casey` of `Clownfish` type. We then looped through the tuple of the two objects and call `swim()`, `swim_backwards()`, and `skeleton()` for each object. 

When we run the code above, we will see this on our screen:

```
The shark is swimming.
The shark cannot swim backwards, but can sink backwards.
The shark's skeleton is made of cartilage.

The clownfish is swimming.
The clownfish can swim backwards.
The clownfish's skeleton is made of bone.
```

Let's have some more fun! Let's create a function called `in_the_pacific()` that takes in an object called `fish`. `in_the_pacific()` calls the `swim()` function.

```python
def in_the_pacific(fish):
    fish.swim()
```

Let's instantiate two objects of `Shark` and `Clownfish` type respectively. 

```
sammy = Shark()

casey = Clownfish()

in_the_pacific(sammy)
in_the_pacific(casey)
```

Let's run the code above! We will see the following outputted:

```python
The shark is swimming.
The clownfish is swimming.
```
