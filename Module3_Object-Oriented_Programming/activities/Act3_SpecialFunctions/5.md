Consider this code below:

```python
class Vehicle:
    def __init__(self, number_of_wheels, type_of_tank,          	seating_capacity, maximum_velocity):
        self.number_of_wheels = number_of_wheels
        self.type_of_tank = type_of_tank
        self.seating_capacity = seating_capacity
        self.maximum_velocity = maximum_velocity

    def number_of_wheels(self): # return the number_of_wheels    		atribute --> this is called a getter, and are useful when the user wants to access a private attribute
        return self.number_of_wheels

    def set_number_of_wheels(self, number): # set the        		number_of_wheels with the passed-in argument --> this is called a setter, and are userful when the user wants to change a private attribute
        self.number_of_wheels = number
```

We use `@property` for shorthand purposes with the dot notation.

```python
# Without @property
class A:
    def x(self):
        return 3

a = A()
print(a.x()) # prints 3

# With @property
class A:
    @property
    def x(self):
        return 3

a = A()
print(a.x) # prints 3
```

In Python, it is untraditionally to do the above when implementing getters and setters. We use `@property`, a built-in decorator, to define getters and setters.

```python
class Vehicle:
    def __init__(self, number_of_wheels, type_of_tank, seating_capacity, maximum_velocity):
        self.number_of_wheels = number_of_wheels
        self.type_of_tank = type_of_tank
        self.seating_capacity = seating_capacity
        self.maximum_velocity = maximum_velocity
    
    # getter
    @property
    def number_of_wheels(self):
        return self.__number_of_wheels
    
    # setter
    @number_of_wheels.setter
    def number_of_wheels(self, number):
        self.__number_of_wheels = number
```

We can now use these methods.

```python
tesla_model_s = Vehicle(4, 'electric', 5, 250)
print(tesla_model_s.number_of_wheels) # 4
tesla_model_s.number_of_wheels = 2 # setting number of wheels to 2
print(tesla_model_s.number_of_wheels) # 2
```
