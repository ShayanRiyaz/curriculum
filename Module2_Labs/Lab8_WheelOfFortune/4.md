The player can choose to guess the hidden phrase by typing 'guess' and then their guess. If their guess is correct, print the amount of money they have and the hidden phrase. They earn a set amount for each letter correct and vowels don't cost anything. If it is not correct, they should continue guessing letters. Print the hidden phrase, and value of letters, and continue guessing.

Also consider the case where they repeat a guess.

When they guess a vowel, each correct vowel costs $500.

If their guess is valid, add it to the correct blanks of the hidden phrase. Then print the money they have, the hidden phrase, the values of correct letters and cost of vowels.

Example of what the game looks like in action:

```
Guess one letter at a time. If you want to buy a vowel, you must have at least $500, otherwise, you cannot buy a vowel. If you think you know the word or phrase, type 'guess' to guess the word or phrase. You will earn each letter at a set amount and vowels will not cost anything.

In the event that user chooses a letter that they have already guessed, the output should be:

```
$1750 per correct letter
$500 per vowel
s
You've already picked that letter!
You have: $4000

```

The user can also guess the word:

```
