If everything else is false, that means that the guess is in the alphabet and has not been guessed.

First remove the letter from the alphabet.

Iterate through the hidden phrase, each time comparing the guess with a character in the correct phrase.

At every spot where, there is a matching letter, insert the letter into a blank and increase the player's money according by the amount that a correct letter is worth.

Print the money the player has and the hidden phrase and check if there are any blanks.
