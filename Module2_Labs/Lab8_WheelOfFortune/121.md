Create a dictionary, `categories`, where the key is the category and the value is a list of hidden phrases that belong to that category.

```python
categories = {'color': ['red', 'green', 'blue', 'yellow', 'turqouise', 'purple', 'indigo', 'white', 'black'],
              'phrase': ["it's raining cats and dogs", "speak of the devil", "the best of both worlds", "see eye to eye", "when pigs fly", "costs an arm and a leg", "once in a blue moon", "a piece of cake", "let the cat out of the bag", "feeling under the weather", "kill two birds with one stone"]}
```

In order to randomly pick a category, import `randint` from `random`.

```python
from random import randint
```

The syntax for using `randint `is `randint(start, end)` and it returns a random integer between start and end.

We want to pick a random number within the range of the number of keys in the dictionary `categories`. 

Store the category picked in a variable `category`.

```python
category = randint(0, (len(categories) - 1))
```
