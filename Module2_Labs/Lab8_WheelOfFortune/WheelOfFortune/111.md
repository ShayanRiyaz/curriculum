Create a list of set amounts that correct letters will earn called `amounts`.

```python
amounts = [500, 750, 1000, 1250, 1500, 1750, 5000]
```

To keep track of how much money the player has create and initialize a variable called `total` to `0`.

```python
total = 0
```

Create a list of letters called `alphabet` to keep track of what has been guessed.

```python
alphabet = ['A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E', 'F', 'G', 'H', 'I', 'J', 'K', 'L', 'M', 'N', 'O', 'P', 'Q', 'R', 'S', 'T', 'U', 'V', 'W', 'X', 'Y', 'Z']
```

Also create a list of vowels called `vowels`, so they can be identified.

```python
vowels = ['A', 'E', 'I', 'O', 'U']
```
