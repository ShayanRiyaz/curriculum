Create a function, `printWord`, that prints out the hidden phrase. 

```python
def printWord(word):
```

Iterate through `word`, printing a space after every character and a new line at the end.

```python
	for char in word:
        print(char, end=' ')
    print()
```

Then print the hidden phrase, `word`, by calling the `printWord` function you just made.

```python
printWord(word)
```
