The player can choose to guess the hidden phrase by typing 'guess' and then their guess. So first check if the input is 'guess'. 

If it is, then get the user's guess and make it uppercase.

Check if the guess is correct by comparing each character.

If their guess is correct, insert the guess into the hidden phrase. Also checking if the letter is a vowel because each correct letter earns a set amount and vowels don't earn any. 

If the guess it incorrect, the user should continue to guess letters.

Otherwise continue to check if there are still blanks in the hidden phrase. If there are no blanks, print the word, the amount of money the player has. If there are blanks, iterate through the hidden word and add the player's guess if the guess is correct.

Then print the amount of money the player has and the hidden word.

Also check if there are any blanks.
