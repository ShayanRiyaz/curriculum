Check if the guess is a vowel.

```python
elif guess in vowels:
```

The player needs to have more than $500 in order to buy a vowel.

```python
	if total >= 500:
```

If they have more than $500, remove the letter from the alphabet.

```python
		alphabet.remove(guess)
```

Then iterate through the hidden phrase `Word`, each time comparing the `guess` with a character in `word`, which contains the correct phrase.

```python
		for char in range(len(Word)):
			if word[char] == guess:
```

At every spot where, there is a matching vowel, reduce the amount of money the player has and insert the letter into `Word`.

```python
				total -= 500
				Word[char] = guess
```

If the player does not have enough money, they cannot buy a vowel. 

```python
	else:
		print('Not enough money')
```

Print the money the player has and the hidden phrase.

```python
	print('You have: $' + str(total))
    printWord(Word)
```

Check if there are any blanks.

```python
	if '_' not in Word:
		break
```
