We are given `boardData` and `freeSpaces`, so we need to pass them in to the appropriate functions.

We need to use a **while loop** (in addition to the given one) to assign the player and computer's character.

Inside the given while loop:

* To print the board, call the function we wrote previously.

* To check for winner or tie, also call a function we wrote previously.

For moves:

* Assuming our `main()` function still has a **while loop** that prints the `boardData` and a `turn` variable, we need to alternate between the player and the CPU.
* We can use the **modulus** operator to mod by 2 to check if `turn` is even or odd.
  * When `turn` is an odd number it's the computer's turn.
  * When `turn` is an even number it's the player's turn.
    Combine these two facts with an **if-else** statement.
