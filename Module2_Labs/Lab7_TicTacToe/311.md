**Tuples** can be used to **unpack** multiple data values into multiple variables in a single line. We can extract the row and column numbers into variables `row` and `col`

```python
row, col = random.choice(freeSpaces)
```
Then we need to print out the appropriate message, while converting the integers `row` and `col` into **strings**.
```python
print("Computer: " + str(row) + " " + str(col))
```
Finally, we need to update `boardData` and `freeSpaces`.
For `boardData` the row and columns go from 1 to 3, while indices go from 0 to 2, so we need to account for this by subtracting 1 from `row` and `col`.
```python
boardData[row - 1][col - 1] = computer
```
For `freeSpaces`, we are not going by **indices**, so no need to subtract 1.
```python
freeSpaces.remove((row, col))
```
