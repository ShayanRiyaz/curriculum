For each iteration of the **while loop** in `main()` we should check if either player has won. If there is, then the game should print the appropriate message and exit the loop. Otherwise, the next player makes their move. 

The program waits for the user to enter anything on the message "Press enter to start!". After that, an empty grid is printed out and the game has begun.

We should also have input validation that expresses the following example output.

```python
>>> main()
