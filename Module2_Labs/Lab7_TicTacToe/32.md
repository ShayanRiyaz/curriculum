According to the example output, we only need to use one call to `input()`, so we need to parse this **string** for the row and column.
The `split()` function can do this for us.
We also need to perform necessary **type conversions** for string to integer as well as input validations for checking for a correct call to `split()` via an **if statement** and numerical input via a second **if statement**.
