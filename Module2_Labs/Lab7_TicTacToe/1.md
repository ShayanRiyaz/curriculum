We are going to be writing a Tic-Tac-Toe program.
In the program, we play against a CPU whose moves are random.

We are given only the `printBoard()` function as well as skeleton code for the `main()` function.

The other functions return dummy data to help compile early on, but we should modify or replace those return statements with our own. 

We should be editing `boardData`, a **2D list** that contains information regarding which squares are taken by which players. Each inner list of `boardData` represents a row of the board, while each element of the inner lists represents who owns that square: " " (for a free space), "O" (for player O), or "X" (for player X).

We should also be editing `freeSpaces`, a **list** of **tuples** which are coordinates of the form (row, column). If a coordinate is in `freeSpaces`, then that means that there is a " " in the corresponding element in `boardData`, meaning that no player chose that square yet.

Example output:

```python
>>> main()
Pick X or O: X
How to Play:
Enter a row 1-3 and a column 1-3 separated by a space when it is your turn!
Press enter to start!

 |X|


Computer: 3 3
O|X|X

 |X|O


O won!
```



Finish writing the `assignPlayer()` function. For reference, this is the first function to run from `main()`. It should ask the user whether they want to be: "X" or "O". Any other output should be rejected and the prompt will be asked once again until either "X" or "O" is entered exactly (**case matters**). Return an appropriate **tuple** of both the user's assignment, then the computer's assignment.

Example output:

```
Pick X or O: 
Pick X or O: j
Pick X or O: a
Pick X or O: o
Pick X or O: x
Pick X or O: X
How to Play:
Enter a row 1-3 and a column 1-3 separated by a space when it is your turn!
Press enter to start!
