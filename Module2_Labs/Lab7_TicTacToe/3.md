Rows and columns range from 1 to 3, where `1 1` is the top left square, `3 3` is the bottom right square, and `2 3` is the right-middle square.

The turns alternate between user and computer per iteration.

Write the function `moveComp()` for the computer's move and `moveUser()` for the user's move.

When the computer moves, they move at random.

Users can pick which board they want by typing the row followed by the column of the square they want separated by a single space. (We should prompt them for proper input.)

We need to validate input for the user's move, too. When the user enters in a single string without any spaces, print out "Enter two values separated by a space".

When the user enters two values separated by a space but at least one of them is a non-numerical value, print out "Enter numerical values".

When the user enters two values separated by a space and both are numerical values, but that space is either taken or out of range (Ex: 4, 3), then print out "Invalid choice!".
