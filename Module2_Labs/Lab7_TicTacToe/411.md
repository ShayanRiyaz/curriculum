First, handle assigning characters "X" and "O". Use a **while loop** that only breaks when the user successfully chooses a valid character (when `assignPlayer()` returns `True` for the third returned argument when **unpacking the tuple**)

```python
while (True):
    userChar, compChar, success = assignPlayer()
    if (success):
        break
```

Print out the appropriate instructions that appear in the beginning of the game. They appear once, so put them before the given while loop. There is a pause, waiting for the user to press Enter, so just use `input()` but no need to store it in any variable.

```python
print("How to Play:")
print("Enter a row 1-3 and a column 1-3 separated by a space when it is your turn!")
input("Press enter to start!")
```

To print the board, call `printBoard(boardData)`, and to check for a winner or tie, use an **if statement** because if the game is over, then the while loop should break.

```python
if (checkGameOver(boardData, freeSpaces)):
    break
```



Since turn starts on 1, that means that the first move is made by the user.
Even numbers modded by 2 have no remainder, so we can add this condition into an **if statement** before adding code for the COMPUTER to move, since the computer moves on even turns.

```python
if (turn % 2 == 0)
	# Computer moves
else:
	# User moves
```

Remember, we have functions specifically for the computer and user to move. Call the appropriate ones for both the **if** and the **else**

```python
# Computer's turn
if (turn % 2 == 0):
    moveComp(boardData, freeSpaces, compChar)
else:
    moveUser(boardData, freeSpaces, userChar):
```

We still have to update `turn` each iteration, so only increment it if the move was successful. Only `moveUser()` can return `False` since the user can enter invalid input, while the CPU cannot. This also means we have to check whether `moveUser()` returns `True`

```python
# Computer's turn
if (turn % 2 == 0):
    moveComp(boardData, freeSpaces, compChar)
    turn += 1
else:
    if (moveUser(boardData, freeSpaces, userChar)):
        turn += 1
```

This code snippet should be at the end of our **while loop** in `main()`
