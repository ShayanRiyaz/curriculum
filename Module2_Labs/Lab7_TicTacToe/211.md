For row wins, we can use a **for loop** to iterate through each row of `boardData`.

```python
for row in boardData:
```

Then, we can convert the row into a set to remove duplicates.

```python
testRowWin = set(row)
```

If the resulting set has one element, then the entire row was the same.
However, if that one element is a space (which occurs at the beginning of the game, since all elements are initialized to a space), then it is not a win. We need to check for that too. We can use an **if statement** for both checks.

```python
if (" " not in testRowWin and len(testRowWin) == 1):
	return row[0] # return winner
```



For column wins, we can do something similar.
For the **for loop**, we can use an **index** as the variable instead.

```python
for colNum in range(0, 3):
```

Instead of `set(row)`, we need to **index** `row` for its column. We can either use another **inner for loop** for each column or use **list comprehension**:

```python
testColWin = set(row[colNum] for row in boardData)
```

The **if statement** is similar but for columns:

```python
if (" " not in testColWin and len(testColWin) == 1):
	return row[colNum] # return winner
```



For diagonal wins, we can hard-code the solutions.

First check that the center was taken by either player (not a space).

```python
# check diagonal win
if (not boardData[2][2] == " " and # check center is not " "
```

Then add more conditions to check for

- a top-left to bottom-right win (a shape of this &rarr; \ )

- a bottom-left to top-right win (a shape of this &rarr; / )

```python
# check diagonal win
if (not boardData[1][1] == " " and # check center is not " "
    # check \ win
    ((boardData[0][0] == boardData[1][1] == boardData[2][2]) or
    # check / win
    (boardData[2][0] == boardData[0][2] == boardData[1][1]))):
```

**Note:** This is one if statement and the extra parenthesis on the second and third conditions. There is also an `or` statement between them. `and` is evaluated before `or`.

If all that is `True`, then return the center, since any diagonal win includes the center.



At the end, if no wins then return `False`, since no winner was found.
