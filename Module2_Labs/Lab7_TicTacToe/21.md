For wins by row:
**Sets** are really nice for removing duplicates in a **list**. If the set version of the row has one element, then we can assume the other two elements were removed because they were duplicates, which means that the entire row was the same.

For column wins:
We can use the same logic as the row wins, but be sure to **index** the rows appropriately when forming our set of column values.

For diagonal wins:

We can just hard code it by using an **if statement** for all possible combinations. We can win diagonally by going from the top-left to the bottom right or the bottom-left to the top-right.
