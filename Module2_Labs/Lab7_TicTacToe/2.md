Write a function that checks for a win by any player.

The board size is 3 x 3, so wins are indicated by:

1. A row of all "X" or all "O"
2. A column of all "X" or all "O"
3. A diagonal of all "X" or all "O" in the form of either
   * / (bottom left to top right)
   * \ (top left to bottom right)

Some testing data has been provided in the comments so we can plug them in to test our function.



Then finish writing the `checkGameOver()` function. It should be the first function to run in each iteration in `main()` because if it returns `True`, then the program should conclude. This function uses `checkWin()`, so write that first and test `checkGameOver()` using `checkWin()`
