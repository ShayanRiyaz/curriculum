After getting the user input with `input()`
```python
userPos = input("Player: ")
```
Validate this input by checking if there is a space using `split()`. `split()` returns a **list** of the elements surrounding spaces, so if there is 1 space, a list of length 2 will be returned. Check for this with an **if statement**.

```python
if (len(userPos.split()) != 2):
    print("Enter two values separated by a space")
    return False
```

We can use `split()` to extract a **tuple** out of the input, and perform a **multiple assignment**

```python
row, col = userPos.split()
```
Since `row` and `col` are now **strings**, we need to convert them into **integers** through the type conversion function `int()`. We can carelessly do this in case the casting fails (or else we get an error). We need to validate that the input is indeed numerical.

```python
if (not row.isdigit() or not col.isdigit()):
    print("Enter numerical values")
    return False
```

Now we can cast them.

```python
row, col = int(row), int(col)
```
Then, we can use an **if statement** to check whether the corresponding square is free to pick using `not` and `in`.
```python
if ((row, col) not in freeSpaces):
	print("Invalid choice!")
	return False
```
We use a **continue** statement to allow the user to pick another choice without incrementing `turn` or doing anything else.

Otherwise we then need to update `boardData` and `freeSpaces` appropriately to account for there being one less free space.
```python
boardData[row - 1][col - 1] = player
freeSpaces.remove((row, col))
```

Lastly, if the program passes all the invalidation checks, return `True` here at the end to communicate to `main()` that the move was successful.

```python
return True
```
