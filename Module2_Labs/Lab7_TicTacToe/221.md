First called `checkWin()` and store the result into a variable `winner`

```python
winner = checkWin(boardData)
```

Then have an **if statement** for whether "X" or "O" was returned (meaning a winner)

```python
# X or O won
if (winner):
    print(winner + " won!")
    return True
```

Also have one for a tie (when there are no more free spaces)

```python
# Tie
if (len(freeSpaces) == 0):
    print("Stalemate!")
    return True
```

If none of the **if statements** activated, then that means the game is not over. Return `False` for this

```python
return False
```
