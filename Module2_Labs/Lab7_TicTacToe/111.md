```python
    player = input("Pick X or O: ")
    if (player == "X"):
        return "X", "O", True
    elif (player == "O"):
        return "O", "X", True
    else:
        return "", "", False
```

First, get the user's choice. We will base the return Tuple off of the user's choice solely.

```python
player = input("Pick X or O: ")
```

Use an **if-elif-else** statement for the "X", "O", then invalid input, respectively.

```python
if (player == "X"):
    # player wants to be X
elif (player == "O"):
    # player wants to be O
else:
    # invalid input
```

Let's do the **if** and **elif** first.

The first argument of the Tuple to be returned is the user's choice.

The second argument of the Tuple to be returned is the opposite of the first argument.

The third argument is `True` regardless.

```python
if (player == "X"):
    return "X", "O", True
elif (player == "O"):
    return "O", "X", True
else:
    # invalid input
```

For invalid input, it doesn't matter what the first two arguments are, but we should return **empty strings** for good practice.

The third argument is now `False`

```python
if (player == "X"):
    return "X", "O", True
elif (player == "O"):
    return "O", "X", True
else:
    return "", "", False
```
