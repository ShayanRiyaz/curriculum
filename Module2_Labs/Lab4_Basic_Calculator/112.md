Next, ask the user to choose an option from the menu by using the **Input function** - `input()` .

You can prompt the user with a question by putting it inside the input function.

For each function, select a variable name in which to store the user's input.

In this example, the variable name *choice* has been selected for the user's choice in selecting an operation.

```python
choice = input("Enter choice(1/2/3/4):")
```



Next, create a similar input function to prompt the user to choose their first number. For this input function, use the integer function - `int()` - in order to convert inputted values into an integer number that the calculator will be able to read.

```python
num1 = int(input("Enter first number: "))
```



Finally, create a third input function to prompt for the second number:

```python
num2 = int(input("Enter second number: "))
```
