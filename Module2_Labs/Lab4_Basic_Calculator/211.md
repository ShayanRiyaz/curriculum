There will be four functions for this part of the code, one each for addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

Create a function by defining it and naming it.

First, create a function for addition:

â€‹	`def add(x, y):`

The function is formatted this way in order to allow the function to use two inputs `x` and `y`. When calling the function, two inputted values will be required and these two values will be calculated within the function.

Within that function, use the `x` and `y` variables to calculate the sum of the two inputs. Then, return the  calculated value.

```python
#This function adds two numbers
def add(x, y):
   return x + y
```



Next, create functions for the remaining three operations.
