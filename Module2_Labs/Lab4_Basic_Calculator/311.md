Create the first if statement for choice 1 (Add).

Check to see what the value of *choice* is to see which operation the user has selected.

`if choice == '1':`

If the user selected 'Add', use the add function to add the two numbers that the user selected.

`add(num1,num2)`

For the final product, print the full equation by printing the numbers, the operation symbols, and the final product.

Your code should look like this:

```python
if choice == '1':
   print(num1,"+",num2,"=", add(num1,num2))
```



Next, use else-if statements for the rest of the operations.
