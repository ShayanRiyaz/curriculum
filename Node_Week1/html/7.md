You know how to create an paragraph of text, so it's enough to write your own book using HTML! Sometimes we meet highlighted words in books, like definitions or something. Unfortunately, you don't know how to highlight words in HTML. However, you're here, so that's easy to fix.

 ### Font faces

If you need to make a part of text bolder, then don't forget about `<strong>` or `<b>` tags. Use them as in following example:

```html
 <p>Here are few <strong>important</strong> words</p>
```

This HTML markup will produce this result: Here are few **important** words.

In case with italic highlighting, use `<em>` or `<i>` tags:

```html
 <p>Here are few <em>important</em> words</p>
```

Preview:

|> Here are few *important* words.`<b>` and `<strong>`, as well as `<i>` and `<em>` produce similar results in  browsers. However, they aren't equivalents and interchangeable. `<b>` means just bold text, at the same time `<strong>` is a tag of logical markup and highlights the tagged text. Here again with `<i>` which means italic text and `<em>` for emotional highlighted words.

 ### Upper and lower indexes

An index relative to a text is the shift (up or down) of characters relative to the baseline. Depending on shifting, the index is called, upper index or lower index. They are actively used in mathematics, physics, chemistry and to designate units of measurement. Obviously, there are corresponding tags in HTML for lower and upper indexes:

   » `<sup>` - upper index
   » `<sub>` - lower index

 |> Pythagoras's theorem: a² + b² = c²
