# Reverse Engineering

##### What is reverse engineering?



##### Using Ghidra

Try to use Ghidra on ‘7_reverse_engineering’, figure out what it does and grab the flag!

- Hint: Once you figured stuff out, it might be helpful to use GDB and dump intermediate values without worrying about where those values came from

Remember, always be alert of **ifs**, **loops** and **function calls**!
Good luck!
