# Steps

##### 1) Generating the keys

- ssh-keygen

- - Follow the prompt and generate your keys

  - By default, your public key will be at ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub and your private key is at ~/.ssh/id_rsa

  - You don’t have to specify a password, and SSHing into other machines won’t require passwords either

  - - Do be careful though, if someone steals your id_rsa, your servers are doomed!

##### 2) Putting it on the server

- We are using the reverse shell user as an example

- - If you have access to the CSIF, I highly recommend trying it there

- ssh-copy-id user@server

- - This creates a ~/.ssh/authorized_keys file on the server and adds your id_rsa.pub file in there
  - When you login next, your server will do fancy maths to verify you have the private key based on the authorized_keys file

##### 3) Profit

- Try SSHing into the server again. Notice you don’t have to type in the user’s password!

- Just to recap:

- - On your own computer:

  - - id_rsa
    - id_rsa.pub

  - On the server:

  - - authorized_keys (contains id_rsa.pub)

##### 4) SSH Config files

- Try creating a config file in your computer’s .ssh folder and write the following:

- - Host revshell

  - - HostName daviscybersec.ddns.net
    - User revshell

- This makes it so you can type “ssh revshell” to SSH in the server.

- Be careful: this is convenient, but someone who sees the file will know you have access to a particular server.
